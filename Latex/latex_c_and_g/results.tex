\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

In this section we present the results of the three \glspl{RQ} introduced in Section \ref{sec:introduction}, focusing on the adoption of collaborative and multiuser tools, the advantages and disadvantages of using \gls{AR} solutions in the classroom and the evaluation of the interventions. We will also briefly analyse and summarise the main characteristics of the \gls{AR} applications described in the studies selected.
