\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
Digital transformation is profoundly impacting and disrupting every facet of society, and education is no exception. In the last two decades, several technologies and techniques have impacted the education industry, being the most notorious the irruption of \gls{MOOC}, the widespread adoption of \gls{IWB} and, more in general, the success of \gls{TEL}. 

Despite being first introduced in 1992 as a training tool for Air Force pilots \citep{caudell1992augmented}, it took many years before \gls{AR} was applied in schools as a tool to facilitate learning. Nowadays, thanks to the widespread adoption of devices that support \gls{AR} applications, as well as the availability of software libraries like ARKit\footnote{developers.google.com/ar/}
or ARCore\footnote{developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/} which greatly simplify and speed-up the development process, \gls{AR} has become a technology which is more and more used in educational settings.

Given its surge in popularity, \gls{AR} has become an active research topic and several systematic studies have been performed to analyse how this technology has been used in educational contexts. Some studies presented an analysis of the advantages and drawbacks of \gls{AR} in generic educational settings \citep{akccayir2017advantages, radu2014augmented, diegmann2015benefits} or provided insights on the status of the technology as well as suggestions for future research \citep{cheng2013affordances, arici2019research, bacca2014augmented, pellas2019augmenting}. Other reviews focused on specific subjects, like \gls{STEM} \citep{ibanez2018augmented, nielsen2016augmented}; on specific topics like \gls{AR}-based serious games \citep{li2017augmented, bartolome2011can, laine2018mobile} or the evaluation of the usage of \gls{AR} in schools \citep{da2019perspectives, chen2017review}. \citet{garzon2019systematic} performed a meta-review of 61 studies to measure the impact of \gls{AR} applications in learning effectiveness, showing that at the moment they only have a medium effect on it. Table~\ref{tab:slrsummary} summarises the content of some of the most comprehensive \glspl{SLR} about \gls{AR} in educational settings.

Since the publication of the seminal paper on collaborative \gls{AR} by \citet{billinghurst2002collaborative}, which first discussed how AR could be used to enhance online and offline collaboration, much progress has been done on providing collaborative tools to \gls{AR} applications. To the best of our knowledge, though, there has been no \gls{SLR} about the usage of \gls{AR} applications as tools to improve collaboration between students as well as between students and teachers, or the possibilities provided by multi-user interfaces as an enabler for improved and accelerated learning. 

Cooperative learning, defined as the instructional use of small groups to promote students working together to maximise their own and each other's learning \citep{johnson1991cooperation}, has long been used as an educational approach to improve the students' learning and performance \citep{johnson2008active, kuh2011piecing}. At the same time, how students engage with technology is often driven by how much they can interact with the different tools. Unfortunately, AR per se is neither an interactive media nor inherently a multi-user tool: it is up to researchers and developers to provide such functionalities in an AR-based educational application. With this work, we aim to evaluate which publications described AR applications that provided interactivity and multi-user functionalities and how they affected the students'\ engagement and their academic performance.

The main contribution of this paper is to provide a \gls{SLR} of the \gls{AR} applications deployed in primary and secondary schools, with a particular focus on the collaborative, multi-user and interactive characteristics of such applications. We decided to consider only the articles published after 2015, since in that year the number of publications related to the application of \gls{AR} in education has seen a huge increase (as it is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pappublbg}).

The \glspl{RQ} that we addressed with this study are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \gls{RQ}1: What collaborative, multi-user, interactive \gls{AR} applications have been used in an educational environment in primary or secondary schools?
    \item \gls{RQ}2: What was the motivation for using \gls{AR} as an educational tool?
    \item \gls{RQ}3: How effective are \gls{AR} applications at improving the students knowledge of a subject? How is this evaluated?
\end{itemize}

Besides answering these research questions, we will also discuss the different technologies used by such applications, for example, the hardware required (\gls{HMD}, tablet or smartphone), the way the system tracks information from the real world (marker-based, markerless, location-based), whether the application augments other senses beyond vision, and which design strategies (if any) have been used to make the applications accessible.
