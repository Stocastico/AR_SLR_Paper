Abstract = {{BackgroundCost-effective methods to facilitate practical medical
   education are in high demand and the ``mixed-reality{''} (MR) technology
   seems suitable to provide students with instructions when learning a new
   practical task. To evaluate a step-by-step mixed reality (MR) guidance
   system for instructing a practical medical procedure, we conducted a
   randomized, single-blinded prospective trial on medical students
   learning bladder catheter placement.MethodsWe enrolled 164 medical
   students. Students were randomized into 2 groups and received
   instructions on how to perform bladder catheter placement on a male
   catheterization training model. One group (107 students) were given
   their instructions by an instructor, while the other group (57 students)
   were instructed via an MR guidance system using a Microsoft HoloLens.
   Both groups did hands on training. A standardized questionnaire covering
   previous knowledge, interest in modern technologies and a
   self-evaluation was filled out. In addition, students were asked to
   evaluate the system's usability. We assessed both groups's learning
   outcome via a standardized OSCE (objective structured clinical
   examination).ResultsOur evaluation of the learning outcome revealed an
   average point value of 19.962,42 for the control group and 21.492.27 for
   the MR group - the MR group's result was significantly better (p=0.00).
   The self-evaluations revealed no difference between groups, however, the
   control group gave higher ratings when evaluating the quality of
   instructions. The MR system's assessment showed less usability, with a
   cumulative SUS (system usability scale) score of 56.6 (lower half) as
   well as a cumulative score of 24.2 +/- 7.3 (n=52) out of 100 in the NASA
   task load index.Conclusions MR is a promising tool for instructing
   practical skills, and has the potential to enable superior learning
   outcomes. Advances in MR technology are necessary to improve the
   usability of current systems.Trial registration German Clinical Trial

Title = {{An Augmented Reality-Based Mobile Application Facilitates the Learning
   about the Spinal Cord}},
Journal = {{EDUCATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Health education is one of the knowledge areas in which augmented
   reality (AR) technology is widespread, and it has been considered as a
   facilitator of the learning process. In literature, there are still few
   studies detailing the role of mobile AR in neuroanatomy. Specifically,
   for the spinal cord, the teaching-learning process may be hindered due
   to its abstract nature and the absence of three-dimensional models. In
   this sense, we implemented a mobile application with AR technology named
   NitLabEduca for studying the spinal cord with an interactive exploration
   of 3D rotating models in the macroscopic scale, theoretical content of
   its specificities, animations, and simulations regarding its physiology.
   To investigate NitLabEduca's effects, eighty individuals with and
   without previous neuroanatomy knowledge were selected and grouped into
   control and experimental groups. Divided, they performed learning tasks
   through a questionnaire. We used the System Usability Scale (SUS) to
   evaluate the usability level of the mobile application and a
   complimentary survey to verify the adherence level to the use of mobile
   applications in higher education. As a result, we observed that
   participants of both groups who started the task with the application
   and finished with text had more correct results in the test (p < 0.001).
   SUS results were promising in terms of usability and learning factor. We
   concluded that studying the spinal cord through NitLabEduca seems to
   favor learning when used as a complement to the printed material.}},

   Lab Orientation}},
Journal = {{EDUCATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Lab orientation is a vital part of learning for new students entering
   the university, as it provides the students with all the necessary and
   important information about the lab. The current orientation is manual,
   tedious, suffers from logistical constraints, lacks engagement, and
   provides no way to assess that outcomes have been achieved. This is also
   supported by the results of a student survey which revealed students'
   dissatisfaction with current process of orientation. This study presents
   the design and development of a sample augmented reality mobile
   application, AR-LabOr, for the lab orientation that helps students in a
   quick and easy adaptation to the lab environment by familiarizing them
   with the lab equipment, staff, and safety rules in a fun and interactive
   manner. This application makes use of marker-less augmented reality
   technology and a blend of multimedia information such as sound, text,
   images, and videos that are superimposed on real-world contents. An
   experiment with 56 students showed that they found the novel method of
   orientation using the application more engaging than the traditional
   instructor-led method. Students also found the application to be more
   supportive, motivating, and that it helped them in better understanding

Abstract = {{The behaviour of fluid flow is a complex paradigm for cognitive
   interpretation and visualisation. Engineers need to visualise the
   behaviour mechanics of flow field response in order to enhance the
   cognitive ability in problem solving. Therefore, mixed reality related
   technology is the solution for enhanced virtual interactive learning
   environment. However, there are limited augmented reality platforms on
   fluid flow interactive learning. Therefore, an interactive education
   application is proposed for students and engineers to interact and
   understand the complex flow behaviour pattern subjected to elementary
   geometry body relative to external flow. This paper presented the
   technical development of a real-time flow response visualisation
   augmented reality application for computational fluid dynamics
   application. It was developed with the assistance of several
   applications such as Unity, Vuforia, and Android. Particle system
   modules available in the Unity engine were used to create a
   two-dimensional flow stream domain. The flow visualisation and
   interaction were limited to two-dimensional and the numerical fluid
   continuum response was not analysed. The physical flow response pattern
   of three simple geometry bodies was validated against ANSYS simulated
   results based on visual empirical observation. The particle size and
   number of particles emitted were adjusted in order to emulate the
   physical representation of fluid flow. Colour contour was set to change
   according to fluid velocity. Visual validation indicated trivial
   dissimilarities between FLUENT generated results and flow response
   exhibited by the proposed augmented reality application.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Virtual reality has impacted education, where progressively more
   educational institutions consider its inclusion. The research problem
   derives from the need to study the educational possibilities provided by
   integrating augmented reality into the curriculum, and its effect on
   academic achievement in a diverse class, specifically in the chemistry
   subject. This study examines 60 school-age participants with and without
   special educational needs, and addresses three overarching questions:
   (a) Would integrating augmented reality (AR) technology result in better
   academic achievement? (b) Would knowledge be retained longer by using
   AR? (c) Is there any relationship between academic achievement,
   acceptance and motivation regarding the use of this technology?
   Embracing the socio-constructivist theory of learning and collaborative
   and immersive learning as a framework, this study was carried out using
   a quantitative approach and a pre-experimental design. The AR VR
   Molecules Editor application was used in chemistry lessons. Main results
   showed significant immediate academic achievement and content retention.
   Despite classroom diversity, immersive technologies enhance students'
   learning regardless of whether they have special educational needs (SEN)
   or not. They also acknowledge that AR is a suitable sustainable
   technology that may foster social and cognitive justice and inclusive
   education, and train students that are equally prepared for the dynamic

   Mechanism Influencing User Migration}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{VR technology can help create optimal virtual learning spaces. Such
   spaces offer new visual experiences that break through the limitations
   of time and space and greatly stimulate people's imagination and
   creativity in learning. Currently, the bandwidth required for such
   spaces limits the large-scale application of virtual reality (VR)
   technology for this purpose. With the large-scale deployment and
   application of high-speed networks, however, online education platforms
   based on VR technology will be better able to meet the diversified and
   personalized learning needs of learners. To promote the development and
   popularization of new online education platforms based on VR, the
   factors influencing the migration of learners from traditional online
   education platforms to new platforms need to be understood more clearly.
   A model based on the theory of negative, positive, and anchoring effects
   can explain learners' migration behavior in this connection. To this
   end, a structural equation model based on the PLS variance algorithm was
   used to analyze data obtained through offline and online questionnaires.
   It was found that in terms of ``negative effects{''}, the afunction and
   loyalty associated with traditional online education platforms reduced
   learners' willingness to migrate to new platforms based on VR
   technology. In terms of ``positive effects{''}, the novel interactivity
   and personalization brought by the new platform increased the
   willingness of users of traditional platforms to migrate to new
   platforms. In terms of ``anchoring effects{''}, the system quality and
   relationship quality of learners' use of traditional online education
   platforms, as well as the transfer costs associated with the new
   platform, generated learners' risk perception about platform migration.
   In addition, risk perception not only negatively affects learners'
   migration to the new platforms, but also strengthens their cognition of
   the system quality and relationship quality of the traditional
   platforms, while reducing their interactive awareness of those
   platforms. Therefore, by adjusting the psychological component of
   virtual learning, the online education platforms based on VR technology
   can create high-quality platforms migrating from traditional platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Background: To introduce and evaluate a university vaccination training
   program, preparing final year Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) and Master
   of Pharmacy (MPharm) students to administer vaccinations to children and
   adults in community pharmacy and offsite (mobile and outreach) settings.
   Methods: Final year BPharm and MPharm students were trained to
   administer intramuscular vaccinations to adults and children. The
   education program embedded in pharmacy degree curriculum was congruent
   with the requirements of the Australian National Immunisation Education
   Framework. The training used a mix of pedagogies including online
   learning; interactive lectures; and simulation, which included augmented
   reality and role play. All pharmacy students completing the program in
   2019 were required to carry out pre- and post-knowledge assessments.
   Student skill of vaccination was assessed using an objective structured
   clinical assessment rubric. Students were invited to complete pre and
   post questionnaires on confidence. The post questionnaire incorporated
   student evaluation of learning experience questions. Results: In both
   cohorts, student vaccination knowledge increased significantly after the
   completion of the vaccination training program; pre-intervention and
   post-intervention mean knowledge score (SD) of BPharm and MPharm were
   (14.3 +/- 2.7 vs. 22.7 +/- 3.3;p< 0.001) and (15.7 +/- 2.9 vs. 21.4 +/-
   3.2;p< 0.001) respectively. There was no difference between the BPharm
   and MPharm in the overall knowledge test scores, (p= 0.81;p= 0.95) pre
   and post scores respectively. Using the OSCA rubric, all students (n=
   52) were identified as competent in the skill of injection and could
   administer an IM deltoid injection to a child and adult mannequin.
   Students agreed that the training increased their self-confidence to
   administer injections to both children and adults. Students found value
   in the use of mixed reality to enhance student understanding of the
   anatomy of injection sites. Conclusion: The developed vaccination
   training program improved both student knowledge and confidence.
   Pharmacy students who complete such training should be able to
   administer vaccinations to children and adults, improving workforce
   capability. Mixed reality in the education of pharmacy students can be
   used to improve student satisfaction and enhance learning.}},

Title = {{Augmented reality worksheets in field trip learning}},
Journal = {{INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS}},
Abstract = {{Worksheets are often used during field trips and utilize a learning
   cycle with three stages (exploration, concept introduction and concept
   application) to engage learners in the learning activities of
   observation and exploration. However, traditional paper worksheets do
   not provide multimedia and interactive presentations with physical
   objects, which made learners losing interaction with the physical
   context during field trips and failing to implement all the stages
   completely. This study designed an augmented reality worksheet with a
   three-stage learning cycle and applied it to learning about plants,
   specifically assisting learners in observing and classifying plants. A
   pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design was used to show the effect
   of learning when learners used augmented reality worksheets. Lag
   sequence analysis was used to identify learning behavioral patterns. The
   findings indicate that the learning effect of using augmented reality
   worksheets is much better than that of paper worksheets and improves the
   learners' interaction with plants.}},

   to the current profile of students. This paper aims to study the
   advantages and disadvantages of this trend and to find a balance. To do
   so, we use a quantitative method to evaluate students' profiles and
   their level of satisfaction with the system. The results were obtained
   by a questionnaire and a survey, which show the role and use of
   technologies in the students' environment and the degree of satisfaction

Abstract = {{Games are powerful generators of positive emotions in children and are
   intrinsically satisfying. In this context, our work evaluates the use of
   mobile augmented reality without markers as the technology to implement
   a multiplayer game scenario that can be used to improve socialization,
   communication skills and emotional intelligence in primary school
   children. The present study addresses the usability of two gameplay
   styles and their impact on users' communication and motivation:
   competitive vs collaborative play. The game integrates Mobile Augmented
   Reality (MAR) technology without markers to create a geolocation
   scenario with unlimited physical space. The results indicate that both
   game modes are intrinsically satisfactory for children triggering
   positive emotions such as enthusiasm, enjoyment and curiosity that
   improve the participants' mood and help increase the degree of
   involvement. Moreover, we observed that the collaborative game version
   has a greater impact on emotional affection, social interaction and
   interest. In addition, we observed in our study that the quality of the
   communication in the collaborative mode is good in terms of several
   factors such as sustaining mutual understanding, dialogue management,
   information pooling, reaching consensus, time management and reciprocal
   interaction. Finally, several design implications and suggestions
   related to game time management, scaffolding, mixed
   competitive-collaborative modes, dynamic 3D content and active learning,
   among others, are discussed. The present evaluation contributes to the
   identification of the most relevant aspects to be considered in the
   future design of MAR-based gamification strategies in education.}},

Abstract = {{Technology-enhanced learning has attracted increasing attention of
   educational community focused on improvement of traditional classroom
   learning. Augmented immersive reality (AIR) technologies enhance users'
   perception of reality by augmenting it with computer-generated
   components such as audio, video, 2/3-D graphics, GPS data, etc. The AIR
   introduces new dimensions of learning experience that ensure better
   attention, focus, and entertainment, thereby boosting students'
   motivation and attainment. This work presents an award winning AIR-based
   educational mobile system, code-named AIR-EDUTECH, that was developed to
   help high school students learn chemistry. The AIR-EDUTECH introduced
   new AIR features to help students better understand and learn basic
   concepts of molecular chemistry. It offers immersive 3D visualization
   and visual interaction with the examined structures that provides a
   broader and more retentive knowledge and improves intuition around
   forming basic chemical reactions. The system was introduced and tested
   in a field study with 45 students in the 11th grade chemistry class, and
   its impact was evaluated by the formal assessment quiz along with the
   feedback from survey conducted after the trial. Collected data have been
   subjected to an in-depth multi-modal quantitative analysis that revealed
   that AIR-EDUTECH stimulated significant improvements in understanding
   and retention of the taught content as well as turned learning chemistry
   into a fun, interesting and interactive experience. It also uncovered a
   hidden structure of taught knowledge dependencies and highlighted the
   role that AIR technology could play in reinforcing the retention of
   critical knowledge that may otherwise widen student knowledge gaps.}},

Month = {{FEB 17}},
Abstract = {{For years, immersive interfaces using virtual and augmented reality (AR)
   for molecular visualization and modeling have promised a revolution in
   the way how we teach, learn, communicate and work in chemistry,
   structural biology and related areas. However, most tools available
   today for immersive modeling require specialized hardware and software,
   and are costly and cumbersome to set up. These limitations prevent wide
   use of immersive technologies in education and research centers in a
   standardized form, which in turn prevents large-scale testing of the
   actual effects of such technologies on learning and thinking processes.
   Here, I discuss building blocks for creating marker-based AR
   applications that run as web pages on regular computers, and explore how
   they can be exploited to develop web content for handling virtual
   molecular systems in commodity AR with no more than a webcam- and
   internet-enabled computer. Examples span from displaying molecules,
   electron microscopy maps and molecular orbitals with minimal amounts of
   HTML code, to incorporation of molecular mechanics, real-time estimation
   of experimental observables and other interactive resources using
   JavaScript. These web apps provide virtual alternatives to physical,
   plastic-made molecular modeling kits, where the computer augments the
   experience with information about spatial interactions, reactivity,
   energetics, etc. The ideas and prototypes introduced here should serve
   as starting points for building active content that everybody can
   utilize online at minimal cost, providing novel interactive pedagogic
   material in such an open way that it could enable mass-testing of the
   effect of immersive technologies on chemistry education.}},

Abstract = {{Featured Application The system and the activities presented in this
   manuscript can be successfully employed for the empowerment of social
   abilities in pre-school children, promoting inclusion and preventing
   isolation. Potential applications are also the improvement of weak
   functions in the at-risk population (e.g., on children with
   neurodevelopmental disorders and children with language and
   communication disorders).
   Abstract Virtual reality (VR) creates computer-generated virtual
   environments where users can experience and interact in a similar way as
   they would do in real life. VR systems are increasingly being used for
   rehabilitation goals, mainly with adults, but also with children,
   extending their application to the educational field. This report
   concerns a study of the impact of a semi-immersive VR system in a group
   of 25 children in a kindergarten context. The children were involved in
   several different games and activity types, specifically developed with
   the aim of learning specific skills and foster team collaboration. Their
   reactions and behaviors were recorded by their teachers and by trained
   psychologists through observation grids addressing task comprehension,
   participation and enjoyment, interaction and cooperation, conflict,
   strategic behaviors, and adult-directed questions concerning the
   activity, the device or general help requests. The grids were compiled
   at the initial, intermediate and final timepoint during each session.
   The results show that the activities are easy to understand, enjoyable,
   and stimulate strategic behaviors, interaction and cooperation, while
   they do not elicit the need for many explanations. These results are
   discussed within a neuroconstructivist educational framework and the
   suitability of semi-immersive, virtual-reality-based activities for
   cognitive empowerment and rehabilitation purposes is discussed.}},

   developed a prototype AR interface called TeachAR, and ran two
   experiments to investigate how effective the combination of AR and
   speech recognition was towards the learning of 1) English terms for
   color and shapes, and 2) English words for spatial relationships. We
   found encouraging results by creating a novel teaching strategy using

Abstract = {{The use of augmented reality (AR) in vocational education and training
   can still be considered as being in its infancy, although interest in it
   is growing in response both to its potential for teaching and its
   adoption as a practical tool in various industry sectors. One example of
   early-stage AR use is illustrated from a practicum for training
   apprentices in the chemical industry; this involves the use of various
   AR objects for learning a simple production operation. Although this
   application had been conceived of purely in terms of substitution for
   existing instructional methods, it also gave learners greater control of
   the learning process and created opportunities for collaborative
   learning. Pedagogically, AR can be considered as a mildly disruptive
   technology that favours learner managed learning, a factor that is
   aligned with its ability to support localised decision-making in
   industry. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic
   Augmented reality (AR) tends to favour exploratory, learner managed and
   increasingly, collaborative learning. Evaluations of AR for vocational
   learning are on balance positive, with improved understanding, fewer
   errors and faster task completion or improved learning performance all
   reported. AR is still in the early stages of adoption in vocational
   education and training (VET), with trials and small-scale applications
   dominating. What this paper adds Introducing AR even for simple learning
   tasks affects the pedagogical approaches that are used. Effects include
   greater learner control of the learning process and encouragement of
   reflection-in-action. Implications for practice and/or policy AR is a
   mildly disruptive technology that needs to be considered in terms of its
   pedagogical implications as well as its effectiveness as a learning
   tool. The directions favoured by AR in education and training appear
   consistent with changing skill and learning demands in industry.}},

Abstract = {{Autism is a severe disorder affecting 1 in 160 children globally. Autism
   comprises of several development disabilities such as social,
   communicational and behavioural challenges. Children being diagnosed by
   the autism mainly face a hard time studying curriculum in inclusive
   classrooms based on their IQ level and the autism levels. Although,
   different strategies and learning teaching tools are available to
   support autistic children, only few systems aid them in learning
   efficiently, and are not highly interactive. Thus, the proposed
   Intelligent Education System primarily focuses on providing interactive
   learning experience to the autistic children with IQ level >50\% and
   efficient teaching assistance to their tutors using augmented reality
   and machine learning in both English and Arabic The capability of the
   education system to perform an action, allows the autistic child to
   interact with the playable sand and gain interest. In learning stage,
   once the child scribbles on the sandbox, Kinect 3D camera captures and
   recognizes the drawn image. After the refinement and recognition of the
   image using OpenCV and classification model, the stored set of real
   world object are projected on the canvas. Besides, a webcam captures the
   facial expression of the child, and emotion detection algorithm
   determines the reaction of the child. Based on the child's emotion, the
   current object is projected and pronounced three times to enforce better
   learning. Once the instructor chooses the language and character to be
   taught using the developed mobile application, the system displays it
   over the sandbox and further three objects that starts with the
   particular character are pronounced and projected. The system is tested
   rigorously with large set of users, and the results prove the efficiency
   of the system and happiness of the autistic children in better learning.}},

Abstract = {{The article analyzes the phenomenon of augmented reality (AR) in
   education. AR is a new technology that complements the real world with
   the help of computer data. Such content is tied to specific locations or
   activities. Over the last few years, AR applications have become
   available on mobile devices. AR becomes available in the media (news,
   entertainment, sports). It is starting to enter other areas of life
   (such as e-commerce, travel, marketing). But education has the biggest
   impact on AR. Based on the analysis of scientific publications, the
   authors explored the possibilities of using augmented reality in
   education. They identified means of augmented reality for teaching
   computer science at school. Such programs and services allow students to
   observe the operation of computer systems when changing their

   reality objects and visualize algorithms and data processes. The article
   describes the content of author training for practicing teachers. At
   this event, some applications for training in AR technology were
   considered. The possibilities of working with augmented reality objects
   in computer science training are singled out. It is shown that the use
   of augmented reality provides an opportunity to increase the realism of
   research; provides emotional and cognitive experience. This all
   contributes to engaging students in systematic learning; creates new
   opportunities for collaborative learning, develops new representations

Abstract = {{Augmented reality is an interactive experience wherein digital objects
   are placed on the physical environment. Augmented reality (AR)
   applications have gained popularity especially when smartphones gained
   capable camera sensors, gyroscope, and other sensors. However, there has
   been a lack of framework or recommendations on how to formally teach
   developing mobile AR applications in a classroom setting. In this paper,
   we present a learning content, called ARVRDEV Courseware, that aims to
   teach undergraduate students how to develop augmented reality
   applications deployed on handheld devices. We carefully designed the
   lessons of the course, consistent with AR techniques from literature,
   and designed hands-on activities not typically presented in publicly
   available materials. A pilot run of the course was offered at De La
   Salle University, where a total of 76 undergraduate students took the
   course as an elective during their 4th year. We analyzed the
   effectiveness of the hands-on activities based on the assessment results
   of the students and discussed the outstanding projects developed by the
   students, which are observed to be inspired by the hands-on activities
   designed for the course.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the development of markerless Augmented Reality
   (AR) using ARCore platform, where interactive three-dimensional (3D)
   content was designed and developed based on the learning outcome
   syllabus to enhance the visualization and understanding of the anatomy

   method is based on 2D images and slides, plastic models and cadavers
   have to deal with students' experience issues such as lack of
   interactive, uneasy feeling with dead body and cadavers storing and
   donation. Therefore, more advances using technology such as Augmented
   Reality (AR) in learning method are needed to overcome the current gap
   and enhance the students' learning. Thus, this study aims to develop
   markerless AR specifically focus on the cardiovascular system for
   undergraduate physiotherapy program at UniKL, RCMP. In this study, we
   describe a method used to create markerless AR content using 3D data
   from MRI images and 3D unity as an authoring tool. We present three
   processes, where the first design consideration based on author's
   previous works derived from systematic search strategy were outlined,
   the second 3D model was developed using a real object and subsequently
   converted to an AR asset that can be linked to a unique markerless using
   ARCore platform and the third AR content creation using 3D unity
   authoring tool. This application provides a better visualization for the
   anatomical parts to support for an innovative and flexible learning
   process. We have successfully analyzed the design consideration using a
   systematic search strategy and developed the markerless AR specifically
   for cardiovascular system in anatomy and physiology courses. This study
   has contributed to knowledge in design and development of AR used in
   physiotherapy education. Therefore, this will be a step forward to an
   exploration of design-based research for an AR benefit in

Abstract = {{Heart problems are ``number one public enemy{''} and fighting it means
   to use different weapons. A crucial moment is that of diagnosis heart
   ischemic conditions, which has to be sooner. Doctors can use multiple
   diagnostic modalities like 3D and 4D medical imaging data. Integrating
   medical images from different medical modalities is a difficult task.
   Vitrual reality has proven to be a choice for healthcare. Particularly,
   augmented reality is used for their advantages. We propose a method and
   a platform that can be used for treatment planning and simulation,
   education and patient awareness in cardiology, for collaborative cardiac
   planning, using 3D and 4D data like Cardiac 3D CT or 4D
   Echocardiography. This application can have a module for AR/mixed
   reality for communication with the glasses because this can also be
   important in the education and training of medical students, providing a
   close to reality virtual 3D environment.}},

Abstract = {{Geography education requires the use of spatial thinking and reasoning
   to understand and interpret maps. Effective usage of geographical maps
   is a crucial skill to be developed for students. However, it has been
   found that students' ability to use maps to describe and analyze natural
   phenomena to find solutions to geographical problems is inadequate. One
   reason for this shortcoming is difficulty in comprehension of maps given
   in textbooks or reference books, which is preliminarily due to inherent
   limitations with paper-based maps. Sophisticated technology-based map
   applications are available like interactive maps, Augmented
   reality-based maps, 3D view maps, etc. But there are few learning
   activities around these, leaving the students confused as to how these
   can be used in different contexts to solve problems. GeoMaps is an
   interactive application to improve map comprehension skills of students,
   which includes ability to identify, correlate and synthesize information
   frommultiple perspectives in a map. The activities in GeoMaps are based
   on authentic geography problems. To solve these problems, students can
   overlay multiple maps to correlate various features, and choose
   corresponding filters to focus on particular information. The
   preliminary feedback from potential users is promising, encouraging us
   to explore this idea at a broader context.}},

Abstract = {{It is still an open argument that many AR applications in education
   which require some text on their interfaces impact learning positively.
   Even though the majority of AR educational tools in public domain
   contain English-based text, very few Arabic AR tools were adopted for
   use in teaching and learning, (rephrase the last part, it is not clear).
   It's not clear whether user's and end-user's adoption of Arabic AR tools
   for use in teaching and learning is influenced by the system or the
   environment. That is why this study developed an Arabic alphabet-based
   AR and examined the subjective involvement on its adoption based on the
   Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) approach. An interactive experimental
   evaluation was carried out with the developed app. A sample of 51
   participants have participated in the experiment and responded to the
   structured questionnaire. The analysis of the gathered data indicates
   that the measures of acceptance and adoption of Arabic Alphabet lies
   within the Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), Perceived Usefulness (PU),
   Attitude toward usage ( AT) and Behavioral Intention (BI). These are
   indicators which were used in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).
   Hence the findings of this study indicate that PEOU had the strongest
   impact on PU and both of them influence AT which impact BI of using
   Arabic Alphabet AR app.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual reality (VR), as an informative medium, possesses the potential
   to engage students with immersive, interactive, and informative
   experiences. When presented in VR, immersive virtual environments (IVEs)
   can provide three-dimensional visual simulations that can be used to
   inform students about concepts in specific contexts that would be near
   impossible to achieve with more traditional teaching methodologies. It
   is proposed that existing learning frameworks can benefit from exploring
   the modalities of interaction that are presently afforded via VR from
   the experiential perspectives of the students. An evaluation is
   presented that focused on the appraisal of student experiences of
   immersive technologies as applied in a higher education context,
   specifically in the use of VR for the exploration of geomorphology
   theory by physical geography students. This research supports further
   development of the immersive learning discipline from three different
   perspectives. First, an empathy mapping method was applied to visualize
   student experiences and externalize our observed knowledge of student
   users for creating a shared understanding of their needs and to aid in
   lesson planning decision making when using VR in the classroom. Second,
   student experiences were captured using a technology-focused user
   experience questionnaire to obtain student attitudes immediately
   post-task. Finally, to assist teachers with the creation of a
   student-centered lesson plans that incorporate VR in the classroom,
   eight heuristic guidelines (focus, provocation, stimulation,
   collaboration, control, digital life, learner skills, multimodal
   experience) were developed. It is proposed that these findings can be
   used to provide support for the use of mixed reality and immersive
   virtual environments in learning that encompass the challenges faced by
   students and the interdisciplinary education community at large.}},

   a growing search for ways to create more memorable experiences. Some
   technological solutions, such as Augmented Reality, have proved that

Abstract = {{The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has brought a
   revolution in the teaching learning process. The current generation of
   students (Generation Z) have had access to the Internet, computers,
   smartphones and/or other such devices, since their early childhood. In
   general, these students, in contrast to older generations, are at the
   forefront of adopting new technologies. Therefore, both an evolution and
   a revolution in the classroom environment are required. In ICT,
   Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) play an increasingly
   important role in teaching. AR is the view of a physical real-world
   environment through a device (smartphone, tablet, etc.) including
   images, video and audio. In this way, it is possible to offer an
   enhanced version of reality using technology, whereas VR is the use of
   computer technology to create a simulated environment. AR does not
   replace physical reality; it keeps the real world central, but enhances
   it with multimedia elements.
   There are different types of AR technology, such as Quick Response codes
   (QR codes). QR codes are two-dimensional bar codes that can be scanned
   with smart devices using free QR reader software. The codes can be
   linked to content created by an instructor or to a website. QR codes
   have become widely popular; nevertheless, in spite of their apparent
   popularity, their implementation in higher education is underexplored.
   We present herein the results obtained in two subjects from the Pharmacy
   degree, Pharmaceutical Botany and Organic Chemistry, in which we used a
   blended learning strategy, combining two teaching approaches,
   traditional learning and QR codes. In Organic Chemistry, the
   teaching-learning activity was performed in practical laboratory
   classes, where the groups are small and a closer follow-up can be
   carried out. QR codes of different experimental procedures were included
   in the lab handouts. The codes gave access, through mobile devices, to
   videos explaining the experimental techniques. In Pharmaceutical Botany,
   it consisted in the development of a field guidebook using QR codes that
   link with a short video about vegetation and landscape of specific
   transects to illustrate a particular pattern along which communities of
   plants change. Such videos were recorded by student volunteers during
   the trips throughout the academic year. The teaching material produced
   in the field study sites was shared with fellow students. Additionally,
   electronic copies containing QR codes of both organic chemistry lab
   handouts and the field guidebook were uploaded to the university virtual
   campus. The readiness and use of QR codes and smartphones were evaluated
   during the practical sessions and workshops, and the students were able
   to provide feedback through completion of a questionnaire. Overall,
   student evaluations showed encouraging results.
   In conclusion, QR codes were shown to be a useful tool to enable easy
   access for students to online information as well as enhancing the
   learning experience by using visually appealing interactive content. The
   study provided a good basis for QR code implementation as a valuable
   innovative educational resource in combination with traditional
   teaching.}},

Abstract = {{In the domain of education, an Intelligent Classroom that employs
   Ambient Intelligence technologies can not only improve learning and
   student performance, but also support educators with the various
   educational tasks, such as lecturing, course preparation and classroom
   management. Given that the board is one of the key artifacts of any
   classroom, using technology to enhance it offers students and educators
   rich opportunities by providing access to a wide range of applications,
   capturing and maintaining a simultaneous focus of attention for large
   learner groups, supporting collaboration and encouraging discussion. To
   this end, this work presents the CognitOS Classboard, an educator- and
   student- oriented framework, employed on the ``Intelligent Classroom
   Board{''} - a wall-to-wall projected interactive board- offering a
   variety of tools and applications aiming to support lecturing and
   enhance the learning process. Aiming to create highly engaging and
   fascinating learning experiences for the students, the CognitOS
   Classboard apart from offering access to useful educational
   applications, features sophisticated mechanisms that can transform the
   classroom into an immersive environment on demand. It supports
   multimodal interaction through touch, mid-air gestures, voice commands,
   and user position tracking, while a tablet and a desktop application
   were developed for permitting the management and overview of the board.
   This paper reports the functionality of the ``CognitOS Classboard{''}
   and the findings of an evaluation experiment conducted with User
   Experience experts.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we analyze the concept of Virtual and Augmented Reality
   applied to the new paradigm of emerging learning in education, in
   relation to key concepts focused on gamification, immersion, and social
   interactivity. As Serious Game are growing interest in education and
   training. These visualization and simulation technologies contextualize
   the player's experience in stimulating and realistic environments by
   supporting the awareness of being in a virtual world.
   The heart of this article is the activity carried out during the
   workshop ``Vivi nella Realta Virtuale{''} offered to young people who
   participated in the Salone del Libro 2019 in Turin.
   On that occasion the participants, through innovative equipment (such as
   Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Virtual Wall) had the opportunity to live
   funny and exciting game experiences in virtual environments
   (reconstructing puzzles, rearranging old manuscripts inside a library,
   etc.).
   The children had to store innovative equipment and place it on the
   interactive map. Through the use of cardboards, framing the QR-Codes
   within the special cards, children and young people did not learn the
   meaning of Virtual and Augmented Reality by playing with real
   applications.
   By using controllers and viewers, they had the opportunity to immerse
   themselves in virtual environments and also, through simple
   interactions, they did exercises useful for memory. In addition, to
   stimulate the sense of touch they had the opportunity to really touch
   the technologies printed in 3D, living an educational experience in the
   round.
   The objectives defined to increase learning through these new
   technologies involve the continuous training of the mind by stimulating
   memory in remembering shapes / colors and paths, educating users on the
   correct use of these immersive technologies.
   The participation of users during the different training experiences has
   confirmed the success of new technologies (Virtual and Augmented
   Reality) that represent a real cultural revolution in the educational
   field.}},

Abstract = {{Education, nowadays, is going through a transition process. ``New
   Students{''} require tools that allow them to improve their technical
   knowledge and, besides that, strengthen soft skills such as
   communication and teamwork. Developments that use Virtual Reality and
   Augmented Reality as a means for teaching have shown to have positive
   impacts on factors such as understanding, motivation and agility in the
   learning process of university students. In this article we describe the
   development of two tools, one based on Virtual Reality and one on
   Augmented Reality, to teach Multivariate Calculus to university
   students. The applications through experimentation and collaborative
   observation, allow them to understand concepts such as functions,
   quadratic surfaces, directional derivative, traces and contour lines.
   Both applications provide students and educators the change to
   experiment though digital environments used in a class in multivariate
   calculus. Each application includes two different roles: student and
   educator. The student is an observer. The professor and the students are
   represented through avatars that interact with each other. The educator
   role is more complex, allowing the user to create and modify functions
   and quadratic surfaces and create planes that intersect the surfaces
   that represent the functions.
   Students within the Virtual Reality environment experience ran the
   application on their phones. They used Virtual Reality glasses to
   immerse themselves in the experience and a remote Bluetooth controller
   to walk through the virtual environment. They were able to walk on and
   under the displayed mathematical functions. The instructor, on the other
   hand, created and modified those functions and directed the learning
   experience showing different interactions among planes and surfaces. The
   instructor ran the VR application on a computer.
   Meanwhile, students using the Augmented Reality application, were able
   to visualize functions and surfaces through the camera of their phones
   when pointing to the marker. Each student had the possibility of
   pointing to any place within the surface with a green dotted marker.
   They could also observe overlapping with the surfaces. The instructor
   had the same functionalities as in the virtual reality application.
   This study showed that almost all students encountered the experience
   satisfying and helpful. They thought it was revealing in many ways,
   allowing them to visualize abstract surfaces and traces easily. Also,
   some students pointed out their wish of including these experiences
   since the beginning of the course.
   In the full article, we plan to describe the creation of both VR and AR
   applications and provide data on the student perceptions.}},

Abstract = {{Rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases are a group of devastating
   autoimmune disorders that all share a common debilitating symptom
   fatigue. Fatigue is not widely understood and is often underrepresented
   in treatment regimes. Fatigue is the least successfully managed symptom
   of these conditions; however, it can often be the one of the greatest
   impairments.
   Augmented reality (AR) enhances a person's reality showing a hybrid
   environment where real and virtual objects coexist. Currently
   educational AR applications are saturating the application market, as
   they have shown great potential for increasing comprehension and
   understanding of complex concepts. AR expands user engagement by
   enhancing the learner's enjoyment and enriching their learning
   environment.
   This research explores the development and subsequent effect of an AR
   application on education around fatigue and basic neuroanatomy within
   the general population. The application was created using medical scan
   dataset, a variety of 3D modelling software and a game engine to create
   a functional and interactive augmented application. The application
   explores the effects of fatigue on a person's daily life while also
   laying a foundation of basic neuroanatomy. A pilot test conducted on 14
   participants (8 males, 5 females and 1 other), with ages ranged 16-64 (4
   form range 16 to 24, 5 from range 25 to 34, 1 from range 35 to 44, 3
   from range 45 to 54, 1 from 55 to 64), shows the application is highly
   usable, increases understanding of basic neuroanatomical concepts and
   has the potential to improve understanding of fatigue. Nonetheless,
   further development and testing of the application are imperative so
   that we can gain a better understanding of the usability of the
   application with wider audiences. Future developments will aim to
   further aid knowledge acquisition and enhance understanding of fatigue,
   a complex and widely misunderstood concept.}},

Title = {{Using Augmented Reality to Motivate Oral Hygiene Practice in Children:
   Protocol for the Development of a Serious Game}},
Journal = {{JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: New technologies create possible new ways of action,
   interaction, and learning which is extremely relevant in the field of
   oral health education. There is a lack of protocol in using an immersive
   interactive ludic-educational interface to motivate oral hygiene
   practice in children by means of augmented reality.
   Objective: This study aims to present a protocol on the development of a
   serious game to motivate oral hygiene practice in children.
   Methods: A serious game will be designed by augmented reality techniques
   to improve toothbrushing effectiveness of children aged 6 to 10 years.
   The functional structure of this interface is activated by means of
   movements recognized by Kinect (Microsoft Corp). The toothbrushing
   technique will be available in the game, enabling the children to
   execute the movement in the virtual environment. By identifying errors,
   this game will be tailored to improve the oral health of children by
   correcting the technique and teaching the user the adequate
   toothbrushing method. A template analysis will be performed to identify
   barriers and facilitators in each scenario.
   Results: After the implementation of the virtual interactive and
   immersive panels, enrollment will begin and evaluations will be made by
   means of questionnaires distributed to participants who interact with
   the game. Thus, an analysis of the product efficacy will be conducted.
   The expected outcome will be to obtain a digital instrument to motivate
   oral hygiene practice and enhance health awareness in children.
   Conclusions: The serious game will support the prevention of oral
   diseases by sharing scientific research in the school environment and
   community.}},
