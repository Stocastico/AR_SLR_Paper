Abstract = {{Augmented Reality (AR) offers an enhanced learning environment which
   could potentially influence children's experience and knowledge gain
   during the language learning process. Teaching English or other foreign
   languages to children with different native language can be difficult
   and requires an effective strategy to avoid boredom and detachment from
   the learning activities. With the growing numbers of AR education
   applications and the increasing pervasiveness of speech recognition, we
   are keen to understand how these technologies benefit non-native young
   children in learning English. In this paper, we explore children's
   experience in terms of knowledge gain and enjoyment when learning
   through a combination of AR and speech recognition technologies. We
   developed a prototype AR interface called TeachAR, and ran two
   experiments to investigate how effective the combination of AR and
   speech recognition was towards the learning of 1) English terms for
   color and shapes, and 2) English words for spatial relationships. We
   found encouraging results by creating a novel teaching strategy using
   these two technologies, not only in terms of increase in knowledge gain
   and enjoyment when compared with traditional strategy but also enables
   young children to finish the certain task faster and easier.}},

   serious games}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{143}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Educational Environmental Narrative (EEN) games in Virtual Reality (VR)
   provide rich, highfidelity environments that provide a fully immersive
   and interactive storytelling experience for use in teaching. Yet, it is
   not fully known how learning experience is affected by freely exploring
   the environment (interaction mode) and having an explicit story
   structure. A randomized controlled 2 x 2 study with 42 adolescents was
   performed to correct this omission and find the effect that these two
   factors have on recalling important information and on how a player
   feels when playing a game. They explored an EEN VR game with different
   interaction modes (active vs passive) and story structures (explicit vs
   implicit) and then completed a knowledge test and standardized
   questionnaires, regarding their sense of presence, cognitive interest
   and engagement during the game. Results show that allowing players to
   navigate freely through the game has positive effects on cognitive
   interest and a feeling of presence. An implicitly structured game leads
   to increased recall of spatial information. However, for optimal
   learning of factual knowledge, guidance is beneficial.}},

Title = {{Immersive virtual reality to enforce teaching in engineering education}},
Journal = {{MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS}},
Abstract = {{Prior studies on the use of digital prototyping and virtual reality (VR)
   in designing as well as evaluating new products have shown that VR
   reduces both development time and costs whilst augmenting student
   motivation and creativity. The current study demonstrates that VR and 3D
   prototyping in the context of project-based learning (PBL) promote
   effective communication, increase problem solving skills, and enhance
   learning outcomes. VR and digital prototyping have been extensively used
   in industries for the purpose of product design and usability
   evaluation. In the context of engineering education, many research
   studies have attempted to explore the effect of VR on teamwork,
   engagement, retention, and motivation. In this paper, VR is used in
   conjunction with PBL in self-directed approach to design and implement a
   product using 3D software whilst also using virtual reality immersive
   CAVE display to evaluate their design. The hypothesis is that the use of
   VR with a project-based-learning approach to facilitate the attainment
   of desirable goals in the engineering design project, improved
   achievement of course learning outcomes and promoted effective
   communication. According to the research findings, VR approach
   significantly affected the distribution of cumulative project grades.
   Students' project grades improved, particularly the implementation
   component. In addition, the course outcomes related to project design
   were better achieved in VR approach. The communication and
   problem-solving skills were improved in the VR approach as compared to
   traditional approach.}},

Abstract = {{Choreography is a creative art of defining sequences of movement. The
   choreographing process benefits a lot from the use of digital

   mobile application for choreography generation. We evaluate user
   performance and user experience on the interfaces in terms of task
   completion time, as well as subjective criteria, like mental stress,
   physical stress, and pleasure. Our research contributes to the study of
   how different interaction methods of the same application affect user
   experience. This research also contributes to the study of virtual and
   augmented reality in education and training applications. The results
   verify the effectiveness of augmented reality in developing training and
   design applications, particularly choreography. The augmented reality

Title = {{Design of an app based on gamification and storytelling as a tool for

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Engineering students often have little motivation for biology topics,
   thus tools that promote their interest and motivation are needed to
   improve the teaching-learning process in this area. The tools also
   should aid in the development of student competencies, a key objective
   of the new educational model of Tecnologico de Monterrey, the Tec21
   model. In this context, an interactive approach involving app with
   elements of gamification and storytelling has been designed and tested
   in our project. Results showed that the students felt motivated after
   using the app (p value < 0.05). The element of gamification showed to be
   attractive to the students, but the tool of storytelling did not result
   that attractive (p value < 0.05 and p value > 0.05, respectively).
   Interestingly, students would recommend the use of this app to other
   students and professors (p value < 0.05). Additionally, most of the
   students approved the test involving the fundamentals of the central
   dogma of biology-a series of processes that cells use when replicating
   and when fabricating proteins, and a substantial majority of students
   felt that videos related to this topic are helpful. Thus, this app,
   Bio3D, can be considered in its first-version level as satisfactory in
   its measures of increasing student motivation and improving the
   teaching-learning process regarding the central dogma of biology.
   Further work will entail the upgrade of this app to include augmented
   reality in order to generate a full technological platform supporting
   efforts to increase the interaction and participation of the students
   and the professor in the course, thus enhancing the teaching-learning
   process.}},

Title = {{Research trends in the use of augmented reality in science education:
   Content and bibliometric mapping analysis}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{142}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to reveal research trends over the last six
   years by content analysis and to examine bibliometric results of
   articles related to the use of augmented reality (AR) in science
   education. For bibliometric mapping analysis, a total of 147 articles
   were accessed and for content analysis, a total of 79 articles published
   between 2013 and 2018 years were included from the Web of Science. From
   this, a total of 62 articles were selected for analysis. Our results
   revealed that mobile learning, science education, science learning and
   e-learning were the most used keywords in articles, while the focus of
   more recent articles tended to be on mobile learning. The results showed
   that recent articles have mostly focused on mobile learning and
   e-learning environments. The most-used words in the abstracts were
   education, knowledge, science education, experiment and effectiveness.
   It is evident that recent articles have focused mostly on students'
   knowledge and achievement. Azuma, Dunleavy and Klopfer are the most
   cited authors in this field. This is not surprising as they are probably
   the leading authors on AR in the literature. The most cited journals are
   Computers \& Education, Journal of Science Education \& Technology,
   Educational Technology and Society, Computers in Human Behavior, and
   British Journal of Educational Technology. These are the most prominent
   journals on the use of technology in education. Content analysis results
   showed that ``Learning/Academic Achievement{''}, ``Motivation{''} and
   ``Attitude{''} have been the most examined variables in the articles.
   Since academic achievement is highly influenced by motivation and
   attitude, it is understandable that these variables are considered
   together in reviewed studies. It was found that mobile applications and
   marker-based materials on paper have been the most-favored types of
   materials for AR because these types of materials are easy to use and
   they can be developed easily and practically. Quantitative studies were
   the most used research design type but there have been only a limited
   number of qualitative studies in the last six years. This may be due to
   the increased tendency to use quantitative and mixed studies in recent
   years.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{142}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the effects of Problem Based Learning (PBL)
   assisted with Augmented Reality (AR) on learning achievement and
   attitude towards physics subjects as a part of science education. The
   sample of the study included 91 seventh graders from a province in the
   north of Turkey. A quasi-experimental design with two experimental
   groups and a control group was utilized. Based upon marker-based AR
   technologies, FenAR software was developed to support with PBL
   activities in the classroom. The experimental results indicated that
   integrating AR into PBL activities both increased students' learning
   achievement and promoted their positive attitudes towards physics
   subjects. This technology contributed to students' long-term retention
   of the concepts in the field of physics. In semi-structured interviews,
   the students emphasized that AR applications were more useful,
   realistic, and interesting for their learning; helped them to understand
   and analyse the problem scenarios. Apart from educational advantages, AR
   applications may lead to physical disorders among some of the students.
   It has been suggested that AR technology can be a potential and
   effective tool for activating students' positive emotions in PBL
   process. Moreover, implications on use of AR for physics education and
   recommendations for further studies are also discussed in the study.}},

   Semantic-Level Interaction}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM}},
Abstract = {{Mixed reality (MR) is a powerful interactive technology for new types of
   user experience. We present a semantic-based interactive MR framework
   that is beyond current geometry-based approaches, offering a step change
   in generating high-level context-aware interactions. Our key insight is
   that by building semantic understanding in MR, we can develop a system
   that not only greatly enhances user experience through object-specific
   behaviours, but also it paves the way for solving complex interaction
   design challenges. In this paper, our proposed framework generates
   semantic properties of the real-world environment through a dense scene
   reconstruction and deep image understanding scheme. We demonstrate our
   approach by developing a material-aware prototype system for
   context-aware physical interactions between the real and virtual
   objects. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation results show that the
   framework delivers accurate and consistent semantic information in an
   interactive MR environment, providing effective real-time semantic-level

Title = {{Exploring the learning effectiveness of financial literacy from the
   microworld perspective: Evidence from the simulated transactional
   interactive concurrent system}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING}},
Abstract = {{Because the microworld can create a learning environment that allows
   learners to interact with the real world, the view of the microworld has
   been widely used in education and training. In this study, the simulated
   transactional interactive concurrent system (STICS) was used to provide
   an environment that simulates the stock market trading of the Taiwan
   Stock Exchange; the goal is to explore the effectiveness of using STICS
   in enhancing the financial literacy of students. This study adopts a
   quasi-experimental design approach and divides students into two groups.
   The intervention group was made up of 42 students who learned financial
   knowledge aided by STICS, with a comparison group consisting of 43
   students who learned with traditional lecturing and dictating methods.
   The study found that learners who used the STICS as an aid to learn
   financial knowledge had significantly better learning effectiveness than
   those who did not use STICS, in terms of motivation, attitude, and
   achievement. The intervention group also made significant improvements
   in average scores in learning motivation and achievement after 8 weeks
   of experimental teaching and learning.}},

Title = {{The application of augmented reality and unity 3D in interaction with
   intangible cultural heritage}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY INTELLIGENCE}},
Abstract = {{The current predicament of intangible cultural heritage is its
   vulnerability and rarity, and an expression that is difficult to
   construct in the space-time dimension. It is difficult for visitors to
   really understand and touch these local intangible cultural heritages.
   For this reason, the need to develop new methodologies for cultural
   heritage learning and art appreciation is always present, and this is
   increasingly supported by digital technologies. The research in this
   paper is to apply the self-issuance method to the folk intangible
   cultural heritage center. It is different from the traditional AR method
   of presenting crafts directly through HMD. Instead, the use of low-cost
   technology, Augmented Reality technology and unity 3D technology provide
   a new way of interaction. By using HMD, smartphone, Leap motion and
   software created in UNITY 3D, the application of the augmented reality
   program is achieved. It allows users to interact with the intangible
   cultural heritage easily and fully it in a virtual physical environment.
   Based on the principle of human natural interaction, it can be achieved
   by structured light target image scanning and the design and experiment
   of photographic measurement. Then a local intangible cultural heritage
   model database can be established to provide virtual prototype files.
   The results of the experimental show that the data transmission is
   effective and the three-dimensional interaction between people and
   exhibits can be realized. The research results can be applied to the
   interactive mode practice of the intangible cultural heritage center,
   and provide an effective interactive mode for the intangible cultural
   heritage in the form of augmented reality interaction. In this way,
   visitors can have a deep impression on the intangible cultural heritage
   and the culture can be spreaded widely all over the world.}},

Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the new collaborative
   learning methods and tools used by elite FIFA referee technical
   instructors, referees and assistant referees to master the Laws of the
   Game. These tools allow instructors to learn through practical exercises
   off the field of play, while they carry out activities in a
   participative context in which they can share and improve their
   knowledge regarding the Laws of the Game and consequently the
   interpretations and the considerations soccer referees throughout the
   world use to make decisions on the field of play.
   Design/methodology/approach In this work, we assess a collaborative
   learning experience that took place during the annual FIFA FUTURO III
   courses that FIFA provided to FIFA referee technical instructors from
   its six confederations between 2013 and 2015, where 48 referee technical
   instructors selected from 211 national associations participated. These
   instructors constitute the elite of FIFA's professional training and
   development chain. They teach other referee technical instructors who
   will then instruct international referees and assistant referees all
   over the world with the aim of achieving uniformity when applying the
   Laws of the Game. Findings The course participants showed a high degree
   of satisfaction with respect to these materials and methods, especially
   regarding the possibilities they offer for organizing group discussions
   and for ``learning by doing,{''} and a lack of skills in ICT management
   has been detected for some participants, who have shown a willingness
   and interest to improve their skills in this field.
   Originality/value It is the first time that collaborative learning
   methods are used with interactive multimedia tools that facilitate
   collaborative work in the training environment of soccer referee
   instructors, international soccer referees and assistant referees. This
   paper establishes a basis and a reference for future research on the
   effectiveness of the new collaborative technologies used by FIFA for the
   training of international referees and assistant referees in general.}},

Title = {{Engaging youth in computational thinking practices through designing
   place-based mobile games about local issues}},
Journal = {{INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS}},
Abstract = {{In response to a need to equip youth to become successful contributors
   to our growing digital economy, educators and researchers are exploring
   ways to incorporate computational thinking (CT) for all across
   curricular domains. In this paper, we take a place-based approach to
   examine how and what CT practices youth learn through designing mobile
   games in and for their own communities. We conducted three after school
   workshops with 29 participants (13 female, 16 male, ages 10-16) in a
   rural city in the Western United States. Youth designed place-based,
   mobile games to share stories and experiences about local environmental
   or civic issues using the Augmented Reality and Interactive Storytelling
   (ARIS) programming platform. We collected and analyzed a range of data
   including field notes, design artifacts, screencasts, and final
   reflective interviews. Using Brennan and Resnick (2012) framework for
   studying and assessing the development of CT, we illustrate how youth
   engaged with CT practices and how their local topics facilitated their
   engagement with civic issues beyond the screen. Findings demonstrate how
   youth can engage with CT practices and their local communities through
   designing computational artifacts. We discuss implications for how
   leveraging place-based computational tools afford equitable and
   accessible CT integration in interdisciplinary contexts.}},

   Augmented Photoreality Platform}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Hazard investigation education plays a crucial role in equipping
   students with adequate knowledge and skills to avoid or eliminate
   construction hazards at workplaces. With the emergence of various
   visualization technologies, virtual photoreality as well as 3D virtual
   reality have been adopted and proved advantageous to various educational
   disciplines. Despite the significant benefits of providing an engaging
   and immersive learning environment to promote construction education,
   recent research has also pointed out that virtual photoreality lacks a
   3D object anatomization tools to support learning, while 3D-virtual
   reality cannot provide a real-world environment. In recent years,
   research efforts have studied virtual reality applications separately,
   and there is a lack of research integrating these technologies to
   overcome limitations and maximize advantages for enhancing learning
   outcomes. In this regard, the paper develops a construction hazard
   investigation system leveraging object anatomization on an Interactive
   Augmented Photoreality platform (iAPR). The proposed iAPR system
   integrates virtual photoreality with 3D-virtual reality. The iAPR
   consists of three key learning modules, namely Hazard Understanding
   Module (HUM), Hazard Recognition Module (HRM), and Safety Performance
   Module (SPM), which adopt the revised Bloom's taxonomy theory. A
   prototype is developed and evaluated objectively through interactive
   system trials with educators, construction professionals, and learners.
   The findings demonstrate that the iAPR platform has significant
   pedagogic methods to improve learner's construction hazard investigation
   knowledge and skills, which improve safety performance.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented Reality (AR) is amongst the potential technologies that gives
   advantages especially in education setting. The AR environment is unique
   since it combines real and virtual objects, interactive in real time and
   registered in 3-dimension. Nowadays, Jawi seems to be forgotten by our
   young generation. Until now, those who love and are interested to learn
   and use Jawi are difficult to find. Even the traditional ways of
   learning Jawi in schools cannot help much to solve this problem or to
   attract students to love Jawi. The design and development of AR
   application is different from the traditional application. Understanding
   the design requirements or process helps the developers to produce
   useful, interactive and usable AR applications. This article discusses
   the process of designing an interactive interface for mobile Jawi
   Augmented Reality (AR) application for students in Sekolah Rendah Agama
   (SRA) JAIS. The study is conducted through the analysis, documentations,
   previous works and interviews with teachers in SRA JAIS. The study
   highlights the process of the designing phase, conceptual model of Jawi
   AR, the structure design of Jawi AR content, and the flowchart for
   learning Jawi prototype. The output or findings from relevant designing
   phase will be proposed as a guideline for a development of mobile Jawi

Abstract = {{Early exposure to radiological cross-section images during introductory
   anatomy and dissection courses increases students' understanding of both
   anatomy and radiology. Novel technologies such as augmented reality (AR)
   offer unique advantages for an interactive and hands-on integration with
   the student at the center of the learning experience. In this article,
   the benefits of a previously proposed AR Magic Mirror system are
   compared to the Anatomage, a virtual dissection table as a system for
   combined anatomy and radiology teaching during a two-semester gross
   anatomy course with 749 first-year medical students, as well as a
   follow-up elective course with 72 students. During the former, students
   worked with both systems in dedicated tutorial sessions which
   accompanied the anatomy lectures and provided survey-based feedback. In
   the elective course, participants were assigned to three groups and
   underwent a self-directed learning session using either Anatomage, Magic
   Mirror, or traditional radiology atlases. A pre- and posttest design
   with multiple choice questions revealed significant improvements in test
   scores between the two tests for both the Magic Mirror and the group
   using radiology atlases, while no significant differences in test scores
   were recorded for the Anatomage group. Furthermore, especially students
   with low mental rotation test (MRT) scores benefited from the Magic
   Mirror and Anatomage and achieved significantly higher posttest scores
   compared to students with a low MRT score in the theory group. Overall,
   the results provide supporting evidence that the Magic Mirror system
   achieves comparable results in terms of learning outcome to established
   anatomy learning tools such as Anatomage and radiology atlases.}},

   level of engagement and knowledge retention. In this study, a
   collaborative learning intervention using the REFLECT (augmented reality
   for learning clinical anatomy) system is presented. The system uses the
   augmented reality magic mirror paradigm to superimpose anatomical
   visualizations over the user's body in a large display, creating the
   impression that she sees the relevant anatomic illustrations inside her
   own body. The efficacy of this proposed system was evaluated in a
   large-scale controlled study, using a team-based muscle painting
   activity among undergraduate premedical students (n = 288) at the Johns
   Hopkins University. The baseline knowledge and post-intervention
   knowledge of the students were measured before and after the painting
   activity according to their assigned groups in the study. The results
   from knowledge tests and additional collected data demonstrate that the
   proposed interactive system enhanced learning of the musculoskeletal
   system with improved knowledge retention (F-(10,F-133) = 3.14, P <
   0.001), increased time on task (F-(1,F-275) = 5.70, P < 0.01), and a
   high level of engagement (F-(9,F-273) = 8.28, P < 0.0001). The proposed
   REFLECT system will be of benefit as a complementary anatomy learning
   tool for students.}},

Abstract = {{In the development of a new product, the design team must describe the
   expected effects of the final products to potential users and
   stakeholders. However, existing prototyping tools can only present a
   product imperfectly, due to limitations at different levels.
   Specifically, the physical product model, which may be the product of 3D
   printing, could lack a visual interface; the presentation of the product
   through modeling software such as Rhinoceros 3D does not provide good
   realistic tactile perception; or the interface platforms, such as Axure
   RP, used to display the interactive effects differ from those to be used
   in the actual operation. Thus, we present the VPModel, a high-fidelity
   prototyping tool, able to integrate multiple prototyping methods
   simultaneously. It combines a touchable 3D-printed product model (3DPM)
   and a corresponding visualized virtual model, and the interactive
   interfaces are rendered synchronously in a mixed-reality device. Through
   the tangible, visual, and interactive demonstration, designers and
   normal users can each obtain a similar experience to the experience of
   the finished product. Furthermore, the VPModel also enhances design
   practices by enabling comparisons between modular models. However, the
   implementation of this system is a challenging task, which subsumes
   several fundamental problems as sub-tasks: object detection, real-time
   matching, hand-gesture detection and action recognition. To achieve the
   expected goals of the VPModel, this system uses physical hardware (a
   Microsoft MR HoloLens headset, a Leap Motion Controller, and a 3D
   printer) and existing machine learning algorithms. To evaluate our
   VPModel, we report the user experience of 16 participants, evaluated
   using a closed-ended questionnaire survey, a quantitative analysis of
   task performance, and a qualitative analysis of open-ended interviews.
   The results show a significant improvement in realism and enjoyment
   using the VPModel over the two traditional camera prototype approaches.
   In summary, the VPModel can be used to support design strategy and to
   convey design concepts fully and efficiently, which indicates a
   potential use for the VPModel in shortening product development cycles
   and reducing communication costs.}},

   for pre-class learning}},
Journal = {{INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS}},
Abstract = {{As an emerging learning platform, game-based immersive virtual reality
   learning environments (GIVRLEs) have the potential to solve difficult
   teaching problems. This study designed a GIVRLE by integrating knowledge
   of quadratic functions into gameplay. Forty seventh graders who had
   never acquired that knowledge played the game and took pre- and
   posttests. An additional 60 seventh graders took the same math tests as
   controls. The results showed significant improvements in math
   achievement and learning motivation between the pre- and posttests among
   students who played the game. No enhancement of math achievement was
   found in the control students. The playability survey and user
   experience questionnaire verified the suitability of the game. The
   findings indicate that a GIVRLE is a suitable tool for addressing
   teaching difficulties in K-12. The notion of intrinsic integration
   between learning content and gameplay based on simulated daily activity
   tasks is further discussed.}},

Journal = {{INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS}},
Abstract = {{Augmented reality (AR) has tremendous potential as a teaching and
   learning tool in engineering education to enhance students? learning
   experience; it influences the students? spatial ability for real-time
   visualization. Furthermore, this helps to attain better concept
   comprehension pertaining to improved understanding of the topics. The
   present study provides evidence by developing an AR learning environment
   (ARLE) suitable for complicated theoretical topics of electronics
   engineering, which otherwise cannot be demonstrated using practical
   experiments. The idea of using different design variants; such as mobile
   and table-top for adaptive AR is also implemented. For this, 60
   undergraduate students of electronics and electrical engineering were
   introduced to the ARLE system, in two different case studies. The first
   case validates the efficacy of using AR for learning the concept of
   stability in linear control systems through a questionnaire based survey
   where students reported the ARLE as an effective learning system for
   theoretical topics. Second case study provides comparative analysis for
   usability of two design variants of the ARLE in terms of manipulability
   and comprehensibility. Finally, the design implications for developed
   ARLE are discussed, which may be helpful for other researchers in
   creating learning environments for different courses of engineering

Abstract = {{Although Augmented Reality (AR) technology has already been adopted into
   mobile learning environments, additional effort must be put towards
   providing strong evidence that AR-based mobile systems are excellent
   educational tools that make a positive impact in or outside of the
   classroom. Our study utilized a similar AR-based mobile learning system
   developed to authentically teach a liberal arts course at a Taiwanese
   university. Under controlled study environments, we were able to design
   a system that could impart relevant concepts from the course to students
   outside of the traditional classroom setting. Experimental results
   demonstrated that students with the opportunity to learn through the
   proposed system demonstrated higher learning motivation, had better
   learning performance and comprehension abilities than those studying via
   the conventional outdoor instruction approach. Moreover, the
   questionnaire survey conducted after our study revealed that
   ``confidence{''} was the most highly rated motivational factor among
   students who used the proposed system, suggesting that students were
   quite motivated to learn using the novel system supplemented with
   technological advances because they felt more sure of their knowledge
   and performance. Thus, we believe that using the proposed system can
   effectively improve the learning outcomes of students enrolled in the
   liberal arts course, with the particular benefit of boosting confidence
   in gaining new knowledge, which leads to an improvement of overall
   learning performance and motivation.}},

Abstract = {{Educational institutions demand cost-effective and simple-to-use
   augmented reality systems. ARToolKit, an open-source computer tracking
   library for the creation of augmented reality applications that overlay

   camera and black-and-white markers printed on paper. However, due to
   inter-marker confusion, if the marker distinctions are not ensured, the
   markers are often miss-recognized. This paper presents an
   ARToolKit-based Interactive Writing Board (IWB) with a simple mechanism
   for designing confusion-free marker libraries. The board is used for
   teaching single characters of Arabic/Urdu to primary level students. It
   uses a simple ARToolKit marker for the recognition of each character.
   After marker recognition, the IWB displays the corresponding image,
   helping students with character understanding and pronunciation.
   Experimental results reveal that the system improves students'
   motivation and learning skills.}},

Abstract = {{This mixed-method case study investigated digital literacy (DL)
   development among 32 elementary-level students who created multimodal,
   contextual, and interactive augmented reality (AR) artifacts in a
   20-week after-school program in Northern Taiwan. The instructional
   design combined situated and spiral learning experiences with AR,
   implemented through a blended learning environment. Data sources
   included pre- and post-program digital learning student surveys, student
   and teacher interviews, classroom observations, and AR artifact
   assessments. Results indicated statistically significant increases with
   moderate effect sizes in five areas of students' DL practices:
   information management; collaboration; communication and sharing;
   creation; and evaluation and problem-solving. Students did not increase
   DL in one area: ethics and responsibility. The situated and spiral
   learning-by-design approach offered increasingly complex AR creation
   projects in which students developed and transferred their DL. The
   face-to-face and online learning settings offered multiple ways to
   collaborate and facilitated the development of students' DL. The AR
   technology enabled students to develop DL through designing AR using
   three types of representation features: multimodal, interactive, and
   contextual. Practical and theoretical implications for adapting or
   enhancing this instructional design in future DL programs and for future
   research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Culturally sustainable environmental education is a crucial issue that
   is inseparable from our society and environment; and closely linked to
   our life. Taiwan's cultural environment and family activities are
   characterized by religious beliefs and temple architectures.
   Incorporating digital technology into learning about the cultural
   environment of Taiwan can be an effective way to achieve sustainability.
   To have a deeper understanding of Taiwan's culture and aesthetics, this
   study uses AR (augmented reality) technology to bring interactive
   experiences to the temple, so that the public can interactively
   experience arts in the temple. Through the AR navigation system, people
   can ascertain cultural connotations and understand the power of Taiwan's
   beliefs. This study will take the Wumiao (martial temple) in Yanshui
   District, Tainan, Taiwan, as the research field to examine the learning
   experiences and performance with an AR navigation system. The empirical
   method is used to collect data of users' behaviors and feelings; the
   statistics approach is also used to testify to the AR usability that is
   if with AR technology people can have a better understanding and
   learning performance on the culture aspect. Research finding proves one
   can have a better learning experience with AR tech with a positive
   result. According to the correlation coefficient analysis, only
   perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use are moderately correlated,
   the other differences are highly correlated. It is thus clear that AR
   navigation systems should be applied for having better folk beliefs,
   cultural etiquette learning experiences, and learning performance, more,
   for not merely having faith, but also loyalty as well.}},

Title = {{Feasibility of an augmented reality cardiopulmonary resuscitation
   training system for health care providers}},
Journal = {{HELIYON}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Aim of the study: Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to offer a
   novel approach to CPR training that supplements conventional training
   methods with gamification and a more interactive learning experience.
   This is done through computer-generated imagery superimposed on users'
   view of the real environment to simulate interactive training scenarios.
   We sought to test the feasibility of an AR CPR training system
   (CPReality) for health care providers (HCPs).
   Methods: In this feasibility trial, a CPR training manikin was
   integrated with a commercial AR device (Microsoft HoloLens) to provide
   participants with real-time audio-visual feedback via a holographic
   overlay of blood flow to vital organs dependent on CC quality. In this
   system, higher quality CC visually improved virtual blood circulation.
   HCPs performed a 2-minute cycle of hands-only CPR using only the AR
   system, and CC parameters were recorded. Descriptive data on
   participants' demographics, CC quality, and satisfaction with the
   training environment were reported using quantitative and qualitative
   analysis.
   Results: Between 10/2018-11/2018, we enrolled a convenience sample of 51
   HCPs. The median age of participants was 31 years (IQR 27-41), 71\%
   (36/51) were female, and 67\% (34/51) were registered nurses. CC rates
   (mean 126 +/- 12.9 cpm), depths (median 53 mm, IQR 46-58), and percent
   with complete recoil (median 80\%, IQR 12-100) were consistent with
   guideline recommendations for good quality CPR. Participants were
   predominantly satisfied with the system, with 82\% perceiving the
   experience as realistic, 98\% recognizing the visualizations as helpful
   for training, and 94\% willing to use the application in future CPR
   training.
   Conclusions: As AR is increasingly applied in the healthcare setting,
   integration in CPR training offers a novel and promising educational
   approach. In this convenience sample of trained HCPs, high quality CC
   delivery was feasible using the AR CPR training system which was
   received favorably by most participants.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives:ADVOS multi is a recirculating albumin-based dialysis device
   that supports kidney, liver and lung function by eliminating CO2,
   water-soluble and protein-bound substances. In the present work in vitro
   data on the removal of these substances and CO2 are presented. Methods:
   An ex vivo model using porcine blood was established and applied in
   detoxification tests for water soluble and protein bound retention
   solutes. 3 x 3.3L of blood with high bilirubin (30 mg/dl) and lactate
   levels (>10 mmol/l) were treated with ADVOS multi for 4 hours each. This
   design, with 3 phases changing blood every 4 hours, led to high
   concentrations of both markers in blood during the 12 h test period. For
   CO2 removal tests, 5 liters of blood were used instead. In both cases, a
   continuous CO2 supply through an additional dialyzer was applied.
   Results: Bilirubin and lactate were efficiently removed during 12hrs of
   in vitro detoxification. Lactate removal rates were 90\%, 86\% and 84\%
   for phase 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Bilirubin elimination rates were
   66\%, 62\%, and 57\%, resulting in a total elimination of 1150 mg in 12
   hrs. Albumin binding capacity was determined to be >76\% at the end of
   the treatment indicating that albumin was not denatured in the dialysate
   of the ADVOS system. CO2 removal with ADVOS multi depends on three
   variables: 1) The amount of supplied CO2 depends on concentrate flow
   affecting both, blood pCO2 and bicarbonate levels; 2) blood flow, and 3)
   dialysate pH and composition (i.e., carbonate concentration). A maximum
   CO2 removal of 142 ml/min was achieved with a carbonate-free dialysate
   at pH 10, a blood flow of 400 ml/min and a concentrate flow of 160
   ml/min. Given that blood gases are maintained within physiological
   conditions, a CO2 removal rate of 61 ml/min can be achieved. During all
   the experiments blood pH was set to 7.35-7.45. Discussion:ADVOS multi is
   a device using albumin recirculation in its secondary circuit. Here,
   albumin binding capacity remains stable through a systematic
   modification of its tertiary structure through temperature and pH
   changes in the ADVOS multi circuit. This facilitates the release of
   toxins from albumin and allows for further binding. Moreover, presence
   of albumin, variable dialysate composition and the flexible dialysate pH
   might facilitate the treatment of patients with multiple organ failure.
   Objectives:Given the extent of bypass graft failure, the motivation
   behind this multidisciplinary project is to improve the patency of the
   current bypass grafts by developing a novel and optimised blood flow
   augmentation technique. Methods: One of the most significant
   contributions to the improvement of haemodynamics in grafts was based on
   a research which showed that the `spiral flow' is a natural phenomenon
   in the whole arterial system and is induced by the twisting of the left
   ventricle during contraction and then accentuated upon entering the
   aortic arch. The benefit of this flow pattern lies in removing
   unfavourable haemodynamic environment such as turbulence, stagnation and
   oscillatory shear stress, which are believed to be the main causes of
   intimal hyperplasia at anastomotic configurations. Results:This
   multi-disciplinary engineering venture has resulted in a unique product
   which makes use of both non-planar helicity and an optimised internal
   ridge within the graft to achieve a significantly improved haemodynamic
   condition within the anastomosis (an anastomosis is a surgical
   connection between autologous/prosthetic grafts and veins/arteries
   inside the human body) Discussion:This truly multidisciplinary project
   has integrated fluid mechanics, biomechanics and biology with
   cardiovascular surgery to develop a novel biomedical device, inspired by
   the nuclear engineering sector. The novel spiral-inducing bypass graft,
   nominated for this award, is the best example of how engineering
   techniques, tools and designs can lead to life-saving innovations that
   could potentially save the lives of thousands of people and save
   millions of pounds for the healthcare systems across the world. Such
   successful engineering stories are what would encourage the next
   generation of engineers to go beyond the traditional boundaries of
   engineering disciplines to make a difference.
   Objectives:The goal of this work was to study methods that will allow
   increase in spatial freedom of couplers orientation in inductive
   powering unit for implantable medical devices. An inductive energy
   transfer system is considered, therefore the freedom of relative
   orientation of the transmitting and receiving coils must be optimized.
   Methods:The design procedure of inductive powering unit (IPU) consists
   of two main steps: design of the power amplifier and optimization of an
   inductive link. To account for the patient specifics, such as tissue
   thickness near the implantation site, a number of different couplers
   were simulated using finite element modeling. Effect of coils
   geometrical parameters on mutual inductance and inductive link
   efficiency was examined. Class E power amplifier was chosen as a driver
   for the transmitting coil. Capacitors in the amplifier loading network
   were tuned to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS). A patient's everyday
   activity, including walking and even breathing, leads to misalignment of
   the transmitting and receiving coils, and, as a result, detuning of the
   amplifier from ZVS and increased losses. Feedback schemes were studied
   to compensate the misalignments effect on the amplifier. Results:A
   self-oscillating IPU with class E amplifier was designed that provides
   stable output power about 0.5 W for the distance between the couplers in
   range 10-20 mm and the lateral distance up to 20 mm. The use of
   self-oscillating circuit in the transmitter increases spatial freedom of
   the transmitting and receiving coils corresponding to ZVS. Discussion:
   Inductive link geometrical parameters optimization and implementation of
   self-oscillating class E driver the IPU contributes to stable output
   power and efficiency of IPU. As a result, less intervention from the
   patient and physician is required, and patient quality of life is
   increased Precision medicine emerges from integration of a number of
   emerging technologies and the data they produce with modern data
   analytics. For precision diagnostics and for predicting drug responses
   new computational and in-vitro models are needed from gene regulation to
   cellular and organ functions. Human induced pluripotent stem cells
   (hIPSC) derived e.g., from patient blood cells provide means to produce
   most cell types and thus provide means to get patient specific in-vitro
   models. New technologies are needed to produce tissues from these cells
   and to assess the cell functions in-vitro. In addition, computational
   in-silico models can be used to augment our understanding of the
   diseases or drug effects. They also provide tools to translate the
   in-vitro findings to clinical settings and patient populations. We are
   in transition to turn our in-vitro cell culture models to body-on-chip
   platforms including environmental control and biophysical functional
   sensing. We have developed methods to assess the cellular functions
   based on electrophysiological sensing as well as 2D and 3D bioimaging.
   For example, we have developed imaging methods to assess functions of
   hIPSC cardiac cell with simultaneous assessment of electrophysiology
   such as Calcium and voltage transients as well as mechanobiology in
   vitro. Further, we have developed in-silico models of various cellular
   function including multi-cell-type neuronal networks and in-silico
   population models of the hIPSC cardiomyocytes. The later ones are
   providing us ionic machinery of hIPSC derived cardiomyocyte
   electrophysiology in various populations of patiets.
   We have shown that these computational models can represent pathological
   patient phenotype cells and populations of patients with specific
   mutations, e.g., long QT syndrome. We have also demonstrated the power
   of in-silico as possible pre-screening method for drug effects prior to
   in-vitro examinations. Moreover, our in-silico results highlight the
   need of careful consideration of use of HiPSC models before they can be
   turned from immature cell models to mature tissues in vitro. With
   integration of novel engineering expertise from multimodal sensing,
   imaging and computational modelling, we have shown their power on
   studying diseases and for pre-screening of compounds. Our results
   demonstrate the power of combined in-vitro and in-silco methods for
   future precision medicine.
   Objectives: We have developed in vivo tissue engineered autologous
   vascular grafts constructed in the subcutaneous of the recipient body.
   However, since the formation of the vascular grafts depends on the
   conditions of recipients including high risk or immature patients,
   immaturity in the fabricated tissues might be problematic for the
   severely diseased patients because of their suppressed regenerative
   activity. Therefore, possibility of the xenogeneic or the allogeneic
   implantation of the grafts should be evaluated. The objective of this
   study is to fabricate cardiovascular grafts using xenogeneic or
   allogeneic animals. Methods: Silicone rod molds were placed into
   subcutaneous pouches of beagle dogs, and after 4 weeks the implants with
   their surrounded connective tissues were harvested. Those were
   decellularized with detergents and stored at -20 degrees C for 1 week.
   Decellularized tubular connective tissues (internal diameter: 2 mm) were
   xeno-transplanted to abdominal aorta of the rats. Decellularized tubular
   connective tissues (internal diameter: 5 mm) were cut open and trimmed
   to elliptical sheets of 15 x 8 mm, they were allo-transplanted to
   carotid arteries of other beagle dogs as vascular patches. Results: Both
   xenogeneic vascular grafts and allogeneic patch grafts performed well
   after transplantation, and the luminal surfaces after resection were
   very smooth. Histological evaluation also showed host cells infiltration
   into the grafts. Discussion: Decellularized xenogeneic and allogeneic
   connective tissue membranes could be ideal vascular grafts.
   Objectives: This work aimed to print high-resolution, collagen-based,
   constructs via suspended 3D printing with load-bearing and compositions
   closer to native bone; for potential use as implant materials. Methods:
   Collagen type I (Col) and gelatin methacroylate (GelMA) blends were
   systematically investigated as bio-inks, probing their rheological
   properties and crosslinking efficiency for printing. An adapted 3D
   bioprinter (3DDiscovery, regenHU, Switzerland) based on an extrusion
   principle was used to print constructs. Calcification was investigated,
   in vitro, using a polymer-induced liquid precursor for the
   mineralization process. Results: Careful control over the formulation
   and processing resulted in refined construct properties such as: wall
   width (500um), lattice length (2cm) and shape (bone trabeculae). Once
   printed, the ability to cure the GelMA/Col blends was dependent on
   photo-polymerisation methodology, with enhanced curing and lower
   remaining soluble fractions (10\% vs 40\%) for visible light +
   Riboflavin/SPS in comparison to UV + Irgacure. Control over the
   construct structure allowed defined mineralisation, and subsequent
   material responses. Discussion: In recent years the development of 3D
   printing technologies has attempted to combat the growing need for bone
   repair solutions, although is limited by the number of bio-inks, and
   printable resolutions available. Suspended manufacture has sought to
   address this issue, using a fluid gel to support a secondary
   biologically relevant bio-ink whilst it undergoes a curing step, during
   or post-printing. To date, printing techniques have not been shown to
   provide fully resorbable and/or mechanically satisfactory bone implants.
   This research has shown promise as the first steps towards printing high
   resolution constructs with chemical compositions more closely matching
   that of natural bone. Further works involve deeper investigation of
   calcification and impact on implants mechanical properties and
   microstructure.
   Shifting from treating symptoms to curing chronic diseases by making the
   transformative promise of Advanced Therapies a reality for the benefit
   of patients and society and by making Europe a spearhead of Advanced
   Therapies in Science, Clinics and Biomedical Industry, that is the
   vision of the large-scale research initiative RESTORE - Health by
   Advanced Therapies. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and
   multi-morbidity due to demographic factors represents a high
   socio-economic burden for Europe. The direct health costs increased by
   50\% during the last decade and reached euro1.526bn in 2017, a
   staggering 9.6 \% of Europe's GDP. As current therapies rarely cure, but
   merely fight symptoms, never-ending treatment is required, which means
   diminished quality-of-life, adverse effects and soaring cost for
   society. There is a high need to reach sustainable improvement for
   patients or even to cure them of chronic diseases - in other words, to
   disrupt the paradigm of ``treating symptoms{''} with ``restoring
   health{''}. Advanced Therapies are the game changers that open up
   transforming therapeutic opportunities. For genetic diseases, immune
   diseases, cancer and tissue injury potential cures through Advanced
   Therapies exist - it is reality, not fiction. Some products are already
   on the market, mostly for rare diseases which means only a few thousand
   patients worldwide have benefitted from Advanced Therapies until now. At
   the advent of such a trailblazing change, obstacles and roadblocks
   abound. To make the disruptive promise of Advanced Therapies to cure
   chronic diseases a reality and to make Advanced Therapies accessible as
   standard-of-care for every European patient in need, RESTORE envisage to
   establish a sustainable pan-European ecosystem integrating
   transdisciplinary research, clinics, patients, and industry. Please join
   us for more details. RESTORE is funded by the EU for the preparatory
   phase of the large-scale research initiative (h2020, No 820292).
   Our main objective is to develop safe medical products for a
   minimally-invasive surgical intervention that fulfill all requirements
   by the new Medical Device Regulation (MDR). The secondary objective is
   to minimize the time to market by implementing standard conforming
   processes in a minimalistic way so they can be operated by only a
   handful of people. The twist in the story is that one of our products of
   our system will be individualized in the operating theater. While
   basically everybody is forced to operate in a ``learning by doing{''}
   mode regarding MDR compliance, we do rely on external trainings provided
   by notified bodies and other sources like websites, webinars, and
   dedicated conferences to learn more about how to fulfil regulatory
   requirements. Additionally, we are partnering with our strategic
   investor (a manufacturer of class-III implantable active devices) to
   receive trainings and advice regarding regulatory affairs. However, it
   has to be stressed that one has to consider all parts of the MDR,
   especially the annexes and the applicable norms. Here we present our
   technical approach and our strategy on how we aim full MDR compliance.
   We established a completely digital workflow for all our documents,
   including cryptographic signatures, version history, reviews, mainly
   based on open source tools. This allows us to handle the document
   management very swiftly. We have one person dedicated to our quality
   management system. The risk management is integrated as a
   cross-cutting-concern into all the product development processes. The
   main challenge in the planning and founding phase of OtoJig GmbH was and
   still is to estimate what has to be done, which norms do apply, and how
   much effort (time and money) it is to perform the steps and create all
   the required documents. A difficulty is that contradicting statements
   between the MDR and other applicable norms are still under
   interpretation and public discussion.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to study the influence of person
   physiology and anatomy, which include postoperative edema, movement and
   breathing of a patient, on the results of designing of inductive
   powering unit (IPU) for VAD and to propose design recommendations.
   Methods: A characteristic feature of the IPU is the misalignment of the
   coils. The stability of the VAD power supply (especially with continuous
   powering) is very important. Therefore, it is necessary to design an IPU
   tolerant to coil misalignment. The procedure of geometrical optimization
   for increasing the stability of energy transfer of IPU was performed for
   3 axial distances between coils d (8, 10, 12 mm), which is a typical
   misalignment with a postoperative edema. The lateral misalignment of the
   coils reached the value of the outer radius of the receiving coil (35
   mm), which characterizes the patient movement or breathing. The
   operating frequency was taken 1 MHz, and the output power of the system
   was 10 W. The power drop was within 10\%. The results were verified by
   numerical simulation in MATLAB and PSpice. Results: It was found that
   with a decrease of d from 12 to 10 and 8 mm, the optimal outer radius of
   the transmitting coil increases from 53.9 to 54.6 and 55.7 mm. Turn
   pitch in the transmitting coil increases from 4.9 to 5.2 and 5.3 mm. For
   a receiving coil, turns pitch is increasing from 3 to 3.2 and 3.6,
   respectively. For all cases of d in each coil there are 11 turns (except
   for d = 8 mm, where there are 10 turns in the receiving coil). It is
   recommended to design coils with a slightly larger coils turns pitch and
   the outer radius of the transmitting coil because of disappearance of
   postoperative edema. Discussion: In this work, the influence of person
   physiology and anatomy on the design of IPU for VAD was investigated,
   and recommendations for designing were given.
   Objectives: Membrane oxygenators are an indispensable part of critical
   care medicine. Though necessary to supply sufficient gas exchange, the
   high intrinsic surface introduced by the hollow fiber packing has
   serious side effects on blood platelet parameters. To reduce these side
   effects the membrane surface must be minimized and gas exchange
   improved. Methods: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can support
   oxygenator optimization and supplement experimental data by delivering a
   spatial and temporal resolution of the gas exchange. While current
   research mostly focusses on the gas transport in the blood flow, this
   work presents a fully resolved CFD approach including transmembrane
   transport as well as convective and diffusive blood gas transport on
   shell- and lumen-side of the hollow fibers. Results: CO2 transport in a
   packing segment of a prototype hollow fiber module was fully resolved
   and simulated utilizing an inhouse solver membraneFoam based on the open
   source CFD code OpenFOAM (R). Simulation results show a CO2 partial
   pressure decline from 50 to 15 mmHg in the laminar boundary layer and an
   additional drop of 12 mmHg at the selective membrane surface. Boundary
   conditions for the gas transport simulations were computed by blood flow
   simulations of the whole module. Simulation results were compared to in
   vitro tests comprising measurements of CO2 exchange performance and
   blood side pressure drop of the prototype module. Discussion: Flow
   simulations predict the experimentally determined pressure drop of 68
   mmHg at blood flow rates of 1280 mL/min accurately. The specific CO2
   exchange rate of 220 mL STP/min/m2 is overpredicted due to the reduction
   of the whole packing to an idealized packing segment. Nevertheless, CFD
   allows for a structured optimization of membrane oxygenators as design
   changes can be efficiently investigated.
   Objectives: Anticoagulation therapy in LVAD patients is essential to
   reduce hemocompatibility related adverse events (HRAE). Phenprocoumon
   dose must be adapted and monitored by INR point-of-care-testing (POCT)
   in outpatients. The study aims to determine if the frequency of INR POCT
   in LVAD outpatients has an influence on the quality of anticoagulation
   therapy, HRAE and clinical outcomes. Methods: This retrospective,
   pseudo-randomized study included n=48 patients who received an LVAD
   implantation (HMII, HM3 and HVAD) between Jan. 2012 and Oct. 2016. Based
   on the frequency of weekly INR POCT, we compared a daily (n=36) and a
   3x/week (n=12) group, specifically the 1-year anticoagulation quality
   (\% of INR Tests in Range) as well as clinical outcomes, readmissions
   and HRAE using Kaplan-Meier curves. Readmission profiles and outcomes in
   three groups, based on the achieved quality of anticoagulation (\% of
   INR Tests in Range) ranging from 0-60\% (poor), 60-70\% (acceptable),
   70-100\% (well controlled) were compared. Results: Daily and 3x/week
   groups were similar in demographic and pre-operative risk factors, INR
   target (2.0-3.0, p=0.27) and Aspirin daily doses (p=0.29). Freedom from
   any HRAE (38.9\% vs. 25.0\%, p=0.44), any readmission (72.2\% vs.
   75.0\%, p=0.97) and 1-year survival (91.7\% vs. 91.7\%, p=0.98) were
   comparable in both groups. The \% of INR Tests in Range was
   significantly higher with the daily self-assessments (73.5\% vs. 68.4\%,
   p=0.006). Freedom from any neurological event (91.7\% vs. 75.0\%,
   p=0.14) was n.s. higher in the daily POCT group. Well vs. poorly
   controlled INR POCT patients had a significant higher freedom from any
   neurological event (96.0 vs 69.2\%, p=0.024) as well as hemorrhagic
   strokes (100\% vs. 76.9\%, p=0.011). Discussion: Well controlled
   anticoagulation of LVAD outpatients results in less neurological events
   including hemorrhagic stroke. Daily INR POCT and subsequent dose
   adjustment of vitamin-K antagonists result in a better quality of
   anticoagulation than 3x/week checks.
   Objectives: Spectroscopic method is widely used for non-invasive blood
   glucose (BG) measurement. Despite the progress in implementation of
   transmission NIR-spectroscopic method, applicable mostly for earlap
   measurements, research of non-transmission methods allows for the
   exapnsion of spectroscopy range of use. The aim of research is to
   estimate the penetration depth for 1600 nm radiation using reflection
   NIR-spectroscopy. Sufficiency of penetration depth on this wavelength
   would allow for the use of a mathematical model implemented in the
   transmission method. Methods: The developed experimental setup includes
   a semiconductor laser with wavelength of 1600 nm, two photodiodes,
   reflecting surface, control unit and power supply. For determining the
   position of optical elements a MATLAB program was developed, which
   calculated efficient detected radiation intensity depending on distances
   between the photodiode and the laser and between the laser and
   reflective surface. Scheme for measuring BG by reflection
   NIR-spectroscopy partially repeats the scheme used for transmission
   method. The main differences are in location of photodiodes on the same
   plane with the radiation source, while their optical axes are co-aligned
   and parallel to each other, and the reflecting surface tightly abuts the
   back wall of analytical cell with test solution. Results: The optimal
   distance between the photodiode and the laser is 5 mm, and between the
   laser and the reflective surface is 20 mm. This configuration allows
   intensity of the reflected radiation at about 20\% of incident radiation
   to be obtained. Taking into account the permissible radiation density
   for skin, this value is enough for skin probing to a depth of 1.5 mm.
   Discussion: Reflection NIR-spectroscopy is promising method for
   non-invasive BG measurement. Research of transmission method has shown
   that the penetration depth of 1.5 mm is enough for receiving information
   about BG. Thereby mathematical apparatus applied for transmission
   NIR-spectroscopy can be used and similar error less than 20\% can be
   expected.
   Objectives: Proper anatomical fitting of implants is crucial for a
   successful clinical outcome. However, every patient's anatomy is unique
   and there is a wide variety in the anatomical and morphological
   characteristics among individuals. Virtual fitting based on imaging data
   of a high number of patients has crucial benefits compared to
   conventional approaches during the design process. Methods: Population
   based engineering is a method that enables a virtual implantation
   combined with iterative design optimization based on 3D anatomical
   models created from imaging data of a high cohort of patients. This
   approach was successfully used during the design process of a novel
   inflow cannula for a Ventricular Assist Device and a Total Artificial
   Heart for maximizing the number of treatable patients. The objective was
   to create a design that contains all components, but which at the same
   time works for a wide variety of different body types and sizes.
   Results: The virtual studies have proven to give results that may not
   have been possible with conventional approaches. Compared with cadaver
   studies, this approach was a more accurate and economical way for
   determining the device fit and identifying areas for improvement.
   Clinical trials and in vivo studies of the devices have shown positive
   outcomes. Virtual fitting was able to reduce the risk of inflow
   obstruction, device-vessel misalignment, unexpected variabilities in the
   patient's anatomy and improper patient selection due to anatomical
   constraints. Discussion: Population based engineering is a
   cost-effective solution for including a large number of patients and
   anatomy variations in the design process. Additionally, this approach
   can be used for regulatory submission, e.g. to determine and justify
   anatomical and morphological eligibility or exclusion criteria for
   proper patient selection and/or the correct implant size. This is
   especially important in consideration of the future requirements of the
   Medical Device Regulation (MDR) for patient-specific implants.
   Objectives: None Alcoholic Fatty Liver disorders (NAFLD)is a complex
   systemic disorder becauseit is associated with clinical states such as
   obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes thus involving both
   liver and pancreas. In particular, pathological pancreas (such as in
   diabetic patients, in non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disorders patients)
   led to mis control of insulin secretion (the insulin modulates the lipid
   accumulation in liver). Methods: Organ on chip approaches is one way to
   mimic human physiology. In this paper, we will present the development
   of a liver, pancreas and liver pancreas co-culture model to simulate the
   interaction between both organs. Results: The morphological analysis
   confirmed the rat hepatocytes and the rat Langehrans islets were
   cultivated successfully after the extraction for 7 days. The tissues
   functionality was confirmed by the production of albumin in the liver on
   chip models and by the insulin secretion in the pancreas biochips. The
   RTqPCR analysis confirmed that the pancreas on chip culture contribute
   to maintain high level mRNA of genes related to glucose insulin
   homeostasis when compared to Petri control. Then, the GLP1 drug
   contribute to increase the insulin metabolism in pancreas on chip. In
   liver pancreas co-culture, we found that the presence of pancreas islet
   contributed to modify the mRNA levels of glucose-insulin homeostasis
   related genes in the hepatocytes. It also contributed to increase the
   insulin production when compared to pancreas biochip control.
   Discussion: Those results demonstrated the potential of our liver
   pancreas model to be upgraded to a complex disease model.
   Objectives: We are developing a novel autologous tissue-engineered heart
   valve with a unique in-body tissue engineering. This is expected to be a
   viable bioprosthesis with better biocompatibility. In this study, we
   developed a conduit-type valve without any foreign materials and tested
   the feasibility and long-term availability in large animal experiments.
   Methods: We created plastic molds for Biovalves with a 3D printer easily
   and quickly considering the recipient character. We embedded them in the
   subcutaneous spaces of adult goats for about 2 months. After extracting
   the molds with the tissue en-block and removing the plastic molds only,
   Biovalves with tri-leaflets similar to those of the native valves were
   constituted from completely autologous connective tissues and
   fibroblasts. Total 21 conduit-type Biovalves were implanted in the
   apico-aortic bypass or the pulmonary artery of goats, (8 and 13,
   respectively). No anticoagurants were used after implantation. Results:
   The valves were successfully implanted and showed smooth movement of the
   leaflets with a little regurgitation in angiogram, and the maximum
   duration reached to 3 years 7 months. Histological examination of the
   Biovalves showed the autologous cells covering the laminar surface of
   the valve leaflets as the endothelium and also migrating into the
   leaflet body to construct characteristic tissues like native leaflets.
   Discussion: The valves have a potential to be used for viable
   bioprosthetic valves and to keep better function and biocompatibility
   longer than current ones.
   Objectives: The main purpose of this study is to analyze the correlation
   between different types of dnDSA and AMR after renal transplantation.
   Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the patients after renal
   transplantation from January 2002 to March 2017 in our Center. A total
   of 47 patients with positive PRA and confirmed as dnDSA were included,
   which were grouped according to the DSA binding to C1q, C3d and subtypes
   of IgG. Patients were divided into AMR and non-AMR groups according to
   the pathology of graft biopsy. Results: The pre-transplantation dialysis
   time of the non-AMR group was longer than that of the AMR group in 47
   patients with dnDSA positive (35.4 +33.2 vs 9.8 +10.5, p=0.014).
   C1q-binding dnDSA had no significant effect on the graft survival after
   operation and biopsy. Among 47 patients with dnDSA positive, C3d-binding
   DSA group had lower graft survival time (p=0.009), higher HLA-DP
   mismatch (0.1 +/- 0.3, p=0.043) and higher percentage of pericapillary
   C4d deposition (p=0.042), with statistical significance. The graft
   survival rate of IgG3 subtype negative patients was higher than that of
   IgG3 subtype positive patients (p=0.003). Cox analysis found that the
   risk factors for graft survival included IgG3 (OR = 46.877, 95\% CI =
   4.211-521.830, P = 0.002), HLA-DR mismatch (OR = 0.103, 95\% CI =
   0.021-0.496, P = 0.005), proteinuriuria at biopsy (OR = 2.097, 95\% CI =
   1.184-3.713, p=0.024) and creatinine at biopsy (OR = 1.004, 95\% CI =
   1.001-1.007, P = 1.007) Discussion: Single-center study showed that
   there was no significant correlation between the incidence of AMR and
   different types of DSA. The accurate HLA-DR typing should be emphasized
   during transplantation. The monitoring of specific types of dnDSA will
   help us to take interventions and thus contribute to the survival of
   transplanted kidneys.
   Objectives: Rotary blood pumps (RBPs) are successfully used in high-risk
   treatments, but clot formation still threatens their long-term
   application. To reduce the risk of clot formation, in-vitro
   thrombogenicity testing could help to improve RBP design, as several
   studies have shown. Those studies were able to simulate in-vitro clot
   formation in RBPs, but they had limitations regarding a proper
   quantification of their thrombotic impact. In this study, we assessed if
   thromboelastometric analyses (TEM) are feasible to quantify the
   thrombotic impact of RBPs in-vitro. Methods: Five RBPs (n = 5) were
   placed into simple pump circuits that were built of silicone tubes and
   reservoirs. Each circuit was filled with 150 ml of slightly heparinized
   porcine blood (one donor pig per circuit) and the pumps were brought
   into operation. The pumps operated until a drastic drop in volume flow
   indicated thrombus formation. We carefully cleaned the RBPs from blood
   and documented any found thrombus. Prior to this, blood samples were
   taken at certain time points during pump operation. The blood samples
   were then analyzed by TEM. Results: TEM measurements showed a decrease
   in clotting time (CT) over the duration of the test, which indicates an
   ongoing increase in the activation of the coagulation system caused by
   the pump. Correspondingly, RBPs revealed visible blood clots at
   high-risk thrombus formation spots. Discussion: The decrease in CT over
   time corresponding to clot formation in the RBPs shows that TEM is able
   to detect and quantify the thrombotic impact of RBPs in-vitro. Thus, TEM
   could be used in future studies to compare the thrombogenicity of
   different RBPs by performing comparison tests similar to hemolysis
   testing. This could lead towards a standardization of in-vitro
   thrombogenicity testing of RBPs.
   Objectives: Cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs (TECs) is
   very important to provide such ready-to-use products for regenerative
   medicine and clinical application upon demand. Although cryopreservation
   of isolated cells seems to be well established, there are still a number
   of challenges associated with the cryopreservation of native and
   artificial tissues due to adherent cell state, limited heat and mass
   transfer as well as inadequate cryopreservation protocols. Here, we aim
   at developing an approach for efficient cryopreservation of electrospun
   TECs based on multipotent stromal cells (MSCs). Methods: Blend
   electrospun fibre mats (fibre diameter 0.8 +/- 0.2 mu m, thickness 100
   +/- 10 mu m) were produced from polycaprolactone and polylactic acid
   (PCL-PLA, ratio 100:50) using electrospinning. The fibre mats (diameter
   16 mm) were UV sterilised and seeded with MSCs (5x104 cells/cm2). The
   cells were cultivated on fibre mats for 7 days under static conditions
   and then frozen using 1 K/min cooling rate in a controlled rate freezer
   with different formulations of cryoprotective agents (CPAs), such as
   dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and its combination with sucrose (with and
   without pre-culture with sucrose for 24 h). The viability of cells
   growing on fibre mats was monitored for 2 weeks after seeding and 24 h
   after thawing. Results: The results indicate that PCL-PLA fibre mats are
   biocompatible with MSCs (viability higher than 82\%). Pre-culture with
   sucrose before freezing as well as its addition to DMSO-containing
   freezing medium significantly improved cell viability after thawing.
   Moreover, duration of equilibration of cell-seeded fibre mats with the
   CPAs before freezing affected cell viability post-thaw. Discussion: We
   showed that it is feasible to effectively cryopreserve electrospun TECs
   using controlled technological steps. This work could serve as a solid
   background for further development of efficient cryopreservation methods
   for biobanking of electrospun constructs for vascular or corneal tissue
   engineering.
   Objectives: There have been discussions on effects of pleural effusion
   on the breathing muscles dynamics. In particular, hemidiaphragm
   inversion influence on the pleural pressure (PPL) and ventilation
   parameters has not been precisely determined. The aim of this study was
   to analyze changes in PPL and ventilation parameters in patients
   undergoing therapeutic thoracentesis (TT). Particular attention has been
   paid to inversion of the hemidiaphragm caused by large one-sided pleural
   effusion. The analysis was based on virtual experiments performed on an
   artificial cardio-respiratory patient (AP). Methods: TT was simulated on
   AP, which consists of several cooperating models of the respiratory
   system mechanics, gas transport and exchange, and circulation. Three
   scenarios were considered: a) proper work of the diaphragm, b)
   flattening and fixation of the hemidiaphragm due to the large amount of
   fluid, c) paradoxical excursion of the inverted hemidiaphragm. Results:
   Simulations showed that during progressive pleural fluid withdrawal
   significant changes in the course of PPL were observed, particularly in
   scenarios b and c. Paradoxical excursion of the inverted hemidiaphragm
   significantly influenced the alveolar oxygen partial pressure (PAO2) due
   to a kind of pendelluft: e.g., air flows out from the corresponding lung
   during inspiration and thus it flows to the lung in the hemithorax
   without pleural effusion. Discussion: Flattening and inversion of the
   hemidiaphragm have an influence on several physiological factors of
   which PPL and PAO2 seem to be the most important. Hence, TT may improve
   pulmonary system function particularly in patients with inverted
   hemidiaphragm.
   Objectives: Bone loss at implantation sites on oral cavities is a major
   problem for dental surgeons; in order to combat this issue, we developed
   3 types of colagen biomaterial blends: chondrohitin sulfate, carbon
   nanotubes, and electric stimulated. Methods: Bovine colagen type I was
   dissoluted at 4\% in formic acid 0,1M (Synth - Brazil) and divided in 4
   groups: A- with Chondroitin Sulphate (Sigma Aldrich); B - carbon
   nanotubes suspention (Sigma Aldrich); C- eletric field ; D - control
   group. All of the samples were crosslinked with NHS
   (N-hydroxysuccinimide esters) (Thermo Scientific-USA) and freeze dried
   at a LH2000 equipment (Terroni - Brazil). The samples were analized by:
   SEM; EDS; XPS; Bartha respirometry and FET. Results: All of the samples
   have the same macroscopic morphology. The SEM of the group submitted to
   electric field shows organization of the colagen fibers. The EDS shows
   atomic content of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen with other substances
   Discussion: The absence of contaminants within the samples and the
   increase in stiffness exhibit the compatibility of this material for use
   in bone augmentation in implantology. The material is shown to be not
   toxic, however more tests should be conducted prior to human use.
   Objectives: The optimization of the long term storage of cells and
   tissues is a challenging process with many variables but one factor is
   often overlooked: the freezing device itself. There are freezing
   containers that have to be placed in a -80 degrees C freezer and the
   manufacturer promises a cooling rate of 1 K/min. On the other hand there
   are controlled rate freezers where cooling rates from 0.1 K/min up to 50
   K/min are promised. In this study we compared two commercially available
   freezing containers and four controlled rate freezers with respect to
   their functioning principle. Furthermore, we investigated the accuracy
   of the adjusted cooling rate and the nucleation temperature of the
   samples. Methods: Seven 1.5 ml cryovials filled with 1 ml 0.9\% (w/v)
   sodium chloride solution were dispersed evenly over the rack of each
   freezing device. Constantan thermocouples (type T) connected to a RedLab
   device were placed in the middle of the solution of each cryovial to
   record temperatures every second with the respective software. The
   cooling rates were calculated from the melting point (-0.6 degrees C) of
   the solution to -30 degrees C with n=3. For all freezing devices a
   cooling rate of 1 K/min was set according to the manufacturers
   guidelines. Results: The freezing containers had sample cooling rates
   between 0.5 and 0.8 K/min. All controlled rate freezers showed cooling
   rates similar to the programmed cooling rate of 1 K/min. Higher cooling
   rates resulted in increasing deviations between programmed and measured
   cooling rates. The nucleation temperatures of the samples in the
   freezing containers were mainly between 0 degrees C and -6 degrees C.
   However, the controlled rate freezers showed nucleation temperatures
   mainly in the range of -6 degrees C to -12 degrees C. Discussion:
   Varying definitions from each manufacturer resulted in the observed
   cooling rate differences of the freezing containers. Limited heat
   transfer accounted for the increased cooling rate deviation recorded in
   higher programmed cooling rates.
   Objectives: Patients using ventricular assist devices (VADs) still
   suffer from adverse events such as pump malfunctions or thromboembolic
   events. This can be caused by thrombi that have formed inside the pump
   (pump thrombus). Therefore, there is a great need to prevent such
   adverse events through engineering measures in the early development
   stage of blood pumps. Currently, a numerical model to predict thrombus
   sites inside VADs is still missing and the risk can only be assessed
   with in vitro experiments in the late development stage. A recently
   found model for thrombus formation at high shear rates that was derived
   from simple stenosis experiments promises great potential in the
   application in computational simulations (CFD) of VADs. Methods: In this
   study, advanced high resolution URANS simulations of rotational blood
   pumps were conducted with the flow solver of StarCCM+ (Siemens) at an
   operating point of 5L/min at 75 mmHg. A k- omega SST turbulence model
   and the sliding mesh method was applied. The existing model for
   predicting high shear thrombus formation was applied and compared with
   observations from explanted pumps. Based on these results a modification
   of that model is proposed that suggests a wall normal transport due to
   the change of shear rate in flow direction. This modification was
   realized in the CFD by applying a correlation between the computed
   direction of the pressure gradient and the flow direction. Results: The
   application of the model shows that thrombus sites are overpredicted in
   rotational blood pumps when compared with experimental results or
   observations from explanted pumps. However, with a modification of the
   model which proposes that the influence is a wall normal transport due
   to a change in shear rate, a good agreement was found. Discussion: Since
   there is little data available in the literature that shows the position
   of pump thrombi the validity of these models remains unclear and has to
   be experimentally evaluated further.
   Objectives: Cryptogenic stroke is the cause of 40\% of ischaemic acute
   cerebrovascular events. Study aim was to evaluate the recurrence of
   ischaemic cerebrovascular events in patients successfully treated by
   percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO). Methods: From
   February 2004 to January 2019, 314 symptomatic (243 stroke, 71 TIA)
   patients, (153 M 161 F; mean age 41 yrs, range 10-69) underwent
   percutaneous closure of PFO. 151 patients/314 (48\%) had concomitant
   migraine, 90 (60\%) with aura. 7 different occluder devices were
   implanted by transesophageal echocardiography, for a total of 317
   implants. During follow-up all patients underwent clinical (Rankin
   modified scale) and quality of life (SF36) evaluations, transcranial
   Doppler (TCD), trans-thoracic echocardiography, and MRI. Cerebral and
   angio-MR assessed the degree of lesions by quantitative and qualitative
   comparative analysis performed before and after treatment. Sizes of
   lesions were measured by manual segmentation on the axial, coronal and
   sagittal images acquired. Results: Successful device deployment was
   achieved in 99\% of pateints; patients were discharged home within 3
   days. Follow-up was 100\% complete (median 55.4, range 1-178 months). At
   6 months, Rankin scale was 0 (p<0.0001) in 230 patients (95\%) affected
   by stroke and 10 patients reached score 1. Quality of life improved
   significantly (P<0.0001). In 101/151 patients (67\%) with migraine,
   intensity and frequency of attacks significantly decreased (P<0.0001).
   TCD showed residual microembolic signals in 10 patients, 3 patients
   required secondary successful treatment for an associate defect. TTE
   (after 1, 3, 6, 12 months and once a year for 5 years) showed optimal
   sealing of all devices without signs of erosion, incomplete closure and
   thrombus. In 265 patients cerebral MRI showed no new lesions at 2 years.
   Discussion: Our 15 year experience suggests that percutaneous treatment
   of PFO is safe and beneficial for secondary prevention of recurrence of
   acute cerebrovascular events irrespective of the device used.
   Objectives: Endovascular stent grafting is the standard treatment for
   patients with acute traumatic aortic rupture with extensive associated
   lesions. Very little long term information is available in large series.
   Methods: From March 1999 to September 2018, 83 patients (72 M and 11 F;
   mean age: 37.25 +/- 13.46;range 16 to 69) admitted with acute or chronic
   traumatic aortic lesions underwent endovascular repair. 60 cases had
   acute traumatic aortic rupture, due to road accidents in 69 patients and
   accidental falls in 3 patients. All procedures were carried out in the
   angiography suite. Left subclavian artery was always identified.
   Patients were followed-up in the out-patient clinic and by yearly angio
   CT-scan with regard to survival and complications. The follow-up was
   100\% complete. Results: Endovascular stent-graft treatment was
   successful in all cases of acute or chronic aortic injury. No
   post-operative paraplegia occurred. Control angiography showed optimal
   sealing and complete exclusion of the pseudo-aneurysm from blood flow
   with no primary endoleak. Patients underwent treatment of all associated
   lesions later on during hospital stay. Two patients died in the
   hospital: 1 patient of cerebral haemorrhage and 1 patient of sepsis.
   During the follow-up 5 patients died (survival: 91.4\%) for causes
   unrelated to the aortic procedure. no cases of perigraft leakage or
   aortic disruption were detected. During follow-up 1 patient had a steal
   syndrome and 1 patient paraplegia due to the covering of the left
   subclavian artery by endovascular graft. 4 years after treatment 1
   patient had inner thrombosis of the graft developing a gradient; a new
   endovascular stent graft was deployed successfully. Freedom from
   complications was 92.3\%. Discussion: The outcomes over 20 years of
   follow-up proves that endovascular stent graft repair is the first
   choice treatment in patients with traumatic aortic injuries. Our
   experience demonstrates the feasibility and safety of endovascular
   treatment including patients with extensive associated injuries.
   Objectives: In vitro simulation of an in vivo environment for human stem
   cell research is crucial for any kind of biomedical purpose. While
   important factors like 3D-cultivation and physiological oxygen
   concentrations gain more attention in the scientific community, we still
   lack reliable methods to visualize the hypoxic response of cells in 2D
   and 3D in vitro systems. In this study we present human adipose-derived
   MSCs, modified with a genetically encoded hypoxia-sensor. Methods: We
   used a lentiviral system to stably integrate the genetic construct into
   the chromosomal DNA of mesenchymal stem cells. To investigate the
   features of this novel biosensor we cultivated our cells in a 2D- and
   3D-environment under various oxygen levels and evaluated the outset of
   biosensor-fluorescence via microscopy and flow cytometry. Results: The
   hypoxia sensor was successfully integrated in mesenchymal stem cells and
   could easily be induced by cultivating the cells in a hypoxic condition.
   MSCs, modified with hypoxia biosensors could be cultivated up to passage
   20. Trilineage differentiation of MSCs (adipogenous, osteogenous and
   chondrogenouse differentiation) was also preserved by the cells after
   transfection. Using these cells we could monitor which 3D-cultivation
   conditions lead to hypoxic response of MSCs. Discussion: Our findings
   can help to improve our understanding of the influence of cultivation
   conditions on in situ oxygen concentrations. Moreover, by choosing the
   right 3D cultivation system, MSC can be cultivated in vitro under
   physiological hypoxic conditions.
   Objectives: Heart failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) is a
   progressive disease with a low 5-year survival of <50\%, which affects
   23 million people worldwide. It is characterized by adverse remodeling
   of the left ventricle (dilated cardiomyopathy) due to an increase in
   filling pressures and myocardial wall stress. Pharmacological treatment
   and cardiac resynchronisation therapy have proven beneficial for
   survival. For patients with end-stage heart failure, a heart transplant
   or Left Ventricular Assist Device can be considered. A shortage of
   donors, patient selection and major downsides such as invasiveness and
   driveline infections limit the use of these treatments. Research has
   shown a 13\% decrease in mortality for every 5\% increase in left
   ventricular ejection fraction. Therefore, we developed a smart memory
   alloy configuration in order to increase the ejection fraction and
   obtain an increase of 3,5\% in a bench model. To cope with ongoing left
   ventricular dilatation and rise in wall stress, this should be combined
   with adjustable and measurable ventricular restraint therapy. Our first
   aim is to measure local wall stress during a full cardiac cycle. Next,
   we aim to develop a mathematical model of the left ventricle to
   characterize the left ventricle in HFrEF patients. Methods: We will
   characterize in vivo wall stresses during the full cardiac cycle using
   Transesophageal Echocardiography and a left ventricular pressure
   catheter in 10 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for heart failure.
   With these parameters, we will develop a simplified mathematical model
   of the left ventricle and we will improve our bench model for
   experimental testing. Results: This research will provide a
   characterization of the weakened left ventricular wall and the
   determination of optimal smart material properties and configuration of
   the cardiac assist device. Discussion: With this information, a
   patient-specific HFrEF treatment device will be developed combining
   active cardiac support and restraint therapy.
   Objectives: Clinical data on the hemocompatibility of membranes used in
   double filtration lipoprotein apheresis (LP) is virtually unavailable.
   The present trial compared the hemocompatibility of a recently
   introduced polyethersulfone (PES) based plasma fractionator membrane,
   FractioPES (R) 200, to an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVAL)
   membrane during LP. Methods: In a prospective, randomized, controlled,
   crossover trial, eight patients on routine LP were subjected to one
   treatment with PES plasma (0.6 m(2), 3M PlasCure (R) 0.6) and
   fractionation (1.9 m(2), 3M SelectiCure (R) H19) membranes and one
   control treatment using a set of EVAL membranes (0.5 m(2), Asahi
   Plasmaflo OP-05W; 2.0 m(2), Asahi Cascadeflo EC-50W). Intraindividual
   treatment conditions were kept identical. At defined times, samples were
   drawn at different sites of the extracorporeal blood and plasma circuit
   to measure white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PC) counts, complement
   factor C5a and thrombin-anti-thrombin III (ATIII). Results: With a nadir
   at 25 min, WBC in EVAL decreased to 34 \% of baseline vs. 64 \% at 20
   min in PES (P<0.001). PC only marginally decreased over time with both
   membrane types. Maximum C5a in venous blood was 30.0 +/- 11.2 mu g/L at
   30 min with EVAL and 14.0 +/- 12.8 mu g/L at 25 min with PES (P<0.001).
   Compared to PES (23.3 +/- 15.2 at 5 min and 16.9 +/- 12.3 at 20 min,
   resp.), highest C5a concentrations were found in plasma after the EVAL
   plasma (56.1 +/- 22.0 mu g/L at 10 min; P<0.001) and fractionation
   filters (50.6 +/- 19.4 mu g/L at 30 min; P<0.001). ATIII levels did not
   rise until the end of the treatment without differences between
   membranes. Regarding Lp(a), LDL and HDL removal, both membrane sets
   performed equally (PES, 69.8 +/- 5.7, 64.9 +/- 8.8, and 17.4 +/- 13.6
   \%, resp., vs. EVAL, 69.5 +/- 6.0, 65.2 +/- 6.9, and 18.2 +/- 7.3 \%,
   resp.). Discussion: Compared to EVAL, PES membranes are more beneficial
   with respect to the classical hemocompatibility of extracorporeal
   treatment procedures, namely leukocyte and complement system activation.
   Objectives: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has become a standard
   therapy for adult end-stage heart failure patients. For pediatric
   patients, technological development lags behind with no currently
   approved implantable rotary blood pump. As an alternative, the HeartWare
   HVAD, originally designed for adults, is increasingly used in pediatric
   patients. The aim of this multicenter study was to assess in-silico,
   in-vitro and in-vivo the blood trauma potential of this pump in
   pediatric application. Methods: Blood trauma potential of the HVAD was
   investigated in-silico and in-vitro at an adult and pediatric operating
   point (5L/min and 2.5L/min at 2800rpm and 2200rpm, respectively). The
   flow was simulated by computational fluid dynamics and analyzed
   regarding flow structures, shear stresses and washout. Hemolysis was
   assessed with pumps circulating bovine blood in a temperate flow
   circuit. Clinical outcome and indicators for in-vivo blood trauma were
   investigated retrospectively in 14 pediatric HVAD patients (age 11.3 +/-
   4.8years). Results: In the pediatric conditions, simulations predicted
   elevated mechanical stress profile below 50mPa, more stagnant flow
   field, with longer washout times within the pump. In-vitro measurements
   revealed an increased normalized index of hemolysis (NIH = 17.5 mg/100L
   vs. 8.2 mg/100L, (p=0.0021)). In the retrospective in vivo analysis, LDH
   and D-Dimer values were 1.5 and 3-fold elevated, respectively, compared
   to adult HVAD patients. Major bleedings were observed in 42.9\%,
   suspected pump thrombosis and neurologic dysfunction in 14.3\% of all
   patients. Discussion: The HVAD, operated at lower speeds and flows,
   induces elevated blood trauma. These results highlight the need for
   specifically adapted ventricular assist devices, optimized for the
   pediatric population. Further studies are required to assess the
   clinical implications of these findings.
   Objectives: Native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular
   access for hemodialysis, but it still has high rate of failure due to
   stenosis formation. Convincing evidence supports a key role of local
   hemodynamics in vascular remodeling, suggesting that disturbed flow
   conditions may be related to stenosis development. The purpose of our
   investigation was to explore the feasibility of coupling non-contrast
   enhanced MRI and high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (HR-CFD)
   to relate morphological vessel changes to local hemodynamics in AVF over
   time. Methods: We acquired non-contrast enhanced 3D fast spin echo MRI
   (CUBE T1) at 1 and 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after radio-cephalic AVF
   creation in one patient. We generated 3D models and evaluated lumen
   cross-sectional area changes over time. We perfomed CFD simulations
   using pimpleFoam solver of OpenFoam, prescribing blood flow waveforms
   derived by Ultrasound examination. We computed the 2 components of the
   wall shear stress vector over time, namely WSSdir, the component in the
   mean direction of the WSS vector and WSStr, the transversal component.
   Results: We observed a dilatation of the vein until 6 months, with a
   more pronounced increase in the venous outflow as compared to the
   juxta-anastomotic vein (JAV). The increase in vein's diameter was then
   followed by a narrowing of JAV at 1 year after AVF surgery. We found
   high-frequency fluctuations both for WSSdir and WSStr components, in
   different locations of the vein, at 6 weeks and 6 months after AVF
   creation. Oscillations of both components damped at 1 year after AVF
   creation, as a result of vessel remodeling. Discussion: Optimized CUBE
   T1, coupled with HR-CFD, allowed a characterization of morphological and
   hemodynamic changes over time. Our MRI-to-CFD pipeline represents a
   promising approach to elucidate mechanisms of local vascular remodeling
   and can be used for clinical investigations aimed at identifying
   critical hemodynamic factors responsible for AVF failure.
   Objectives: For 30 years, the mortality rate of patients hospitalized in
   intensive care unit has been drastically reduced. But an increase in
   muscle dysfunctions at the end of intensive care stay, leading to long
   term functional disability was observed at the same time. The
   physiological mechanism remains poorly understood due to a lack of study
   tools. The objective of this work is therefore to create a new tool for
   the tissue construction of an in vitro skeletal muscle. This tool should
   allow a muscle construction which mimics physiological reality, in order
   to model the disease more accurately. Also, it should allow mechanical
   and electrical stimulation in order to simulate the resumption of muscle
   contraction of patients. Methods: Using sol-gel process, we synthesized
   a new biomaterial, based on an epoxy organic-inorganic hybrid precursor
   (g-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane). This biomaterial was deposited as
   a thin layer (spin-coating process) of 7 mu m thickness on a silicone
   membrane suitable to undergo mechanical stretching. The biomaterial was
   microstructured using the UV laser writing lithography to create a line
   network. This line network was revealed with a 2-minute isopropanol bath
   and we obtained lines of 8 mu m thickness spaced of 175 mu m. To ensure
   a biological environment and a strong adhesion of cells on
   microstructured silicone support during mechanical stretching, we
   grafted silylated bioactive peptides using dip-coating process. Results:
   Muscular stem cells which were isolated from patients' quadriceps biopsy
   were seemed and, by immunofluorescence staining, we observed a growth of
   muscle fibers along the lines, mimicking the physiological organization
   of a muscle. Discussion: We were able to model the first stages of a
   complex muscle organoid in vitro using a new tool manufactured by a
   fast, simple and reproducible process. With the mechanical and
   electrical stimulation of this muscle-on-a-chip, this work should allow
   us to better understand these muscle dysfunctions and find new
   treatments.
   Objectives: Cryopreservation of `ready-to-use' tissue-engineered
   constructs (TECs) is a promising strategy which may facilitate their
   future clinical application. This is very challenging and ambitious task
   and therefore recent efforts have been focused on developing new
   cryopreservation strategies for long-term storage of TECs. This work
   covers some practical considerations for cryopreservation of cell-free
   and cell-seeded scaffolds vastly differing by structure and composition.
   Methods: The first test system includes 3D porous
   collagen-hydroxyapatite (HAP) scaffolds prepared by freeze-drying and
   coaxial alginate macrospheres prepared by electrospraying. Samples were
   frozen at 1 K/min either in a bulk DMSO solution (with and without
   sucrose) or after removal of residual solution. After thawing, we
   evaluated compression (collagen-HAP scaffolds) and rheological
   properties (coaxial alginate macrospheres) of cell-free systems.
   Viability of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) within both types of
   scaffolds was evaluated 24-h post-thaw using live-dead assay. The second
   test system comprises flat fiber mats (produced from
   polycaprolactone/polylactic acid using electrospinning) seeded with CHO
   cells. This system intends to develop plate electrodes for
   electroporation of attached cells with non-permeable cryoprotective
   agents (CPAs) such as sugars for future cryopreservation applications.
   Results: All scaffolds were cytocompatible with corresponding cell
   types. Freezing after removal of residual solution was superior to
   conventional freezing. Addition of sucrose increased cell viability
   (both scaffold types) and improved viscoelastic properties of coaxial
   macrospheres. Constructed plate electrodes provided good compromise
   between high cell permeabilisation and viability after electroporation
   with sucrose at 1.7 kV/cm electric field. Discussion: The findings
   suggest that it is feasible to cryopreserve cell-free and cell-seeded
   scaffolds using DMSO and sucrose. As a step further, there are high
   expectations associated with using electroporation as a mean for
   intracellular delivery of non-toxic CPAs towards DMSO-free
   cryopreservation of TECs.
   Objectives: Tailored Forming is a new manufacturing technology to
   manufacture solid components out of two or more different metals. The
   components are joined to a hybrid semi-finished workpiece. Afterwards, a
   forming process is performed to improve the materials properties. This
   allows creating hybrid metallic parts that are adjusted to their
   specific loads and their field of application in comparison to parts
   made out of monomaterials. The potential use case of Tailored
   Forming-parts is still being researched. Biomedical implants are a
   potential field of application. In the presented study, the contact
   mechanics of two potential concepts for Tailored Forming hip implants
   were analysed. Methods: Both concepts consist of a magnesium component
   that should be resorbed in the human body and leads to a better bone
   growth. A second component in the implants is used to absorb loads. In a
   numerical analysis the two implants were compared to a conventional
   implant. For the potential evaluation two load cases ``walking{''} and
   ``walking upstairs{''} were considered. Results: While one concept leads
   to higher stresses in the implant, the other concept shows almost
   similar stress distributions as the conventional implant and has the
   additional advantage of the better bone growth due to the magnesium
   component. Discussion: Based on this work further research on different
   implant concepts has to be made to give a clear statement about the
   potential of Tailored Forming-Implants.
   Objectives: In consideration of the recently published implant files,
   testing of medical devices has gained signifigant importance. Many
   medical implants are subject to normative testing during their
   regulatory approval process, such as stents, heart valves and blood
   pumps. No testing norm or standard, however, exists for regulatory
   approval of left atrial appendage occlusion devices. Therefore, this
   study aimed to establish in-vitro bench tests for LAA occlusion (LAAo)
   devices and compares the clinically most widely used devices. Methods:
   Seven different LAA occlusion systems with device diameter ranging
   between 22 and 34 mm were tested regarding tug force and radial force
   resulting in a total of 24 devices. Radial force was assessed in a
   commercially available tester whereas tug force was evaluated in a novel
   in-vitro test setup consisting of bovine tissue. Results: Significant
   differences in the mechanical properties of the different devices were
   observed. Radial force ranged between 8.6 N at maximum compression for
   the LAmbre 2228 device and 0.1 N for the Occlutech 27 mm implant at
   minimum compression. A similar variability of mechanical properties was
   seen in the tug test results. Values ranged from 4.6 N to 0.4 N for the
   Wavecrest 22 mm and the Occlutech 24 mm device, respectively, at maximum
   and minimum compression. Discussion: Large variations in mechanical
   properties were seen between the different devices. The study showed
   that device stability is more dependent on anchoring structures, such as
   hooks and barbs, than on radial force. A strong positive correlation
   between the number of anchoring structures per millimeter circumference
   of an occluder and its tug force was found (r=0.87, p < 0.01). The large
   variations in mechanical properties aggravate comparison of current LAA
   occlusion devices which underlines the need for standardized preclinical
   testing to prompt clinical compatibility.
   Objectives: Pump thrombosis is a severe adverse event in ventricular
   assist devices. Current therapy often involves an exchange of the entire
   pump. Alternative solutions must be explored to reduce surgery numbers.
   A protocol for in vitro lysis of LVAD specific thrombus with alteplase
   was established in this study. Methods: A fluid chamber of silicone
   tubing was filled with isotonic sodium chloride solution. An artificial
   human thrombus was suspended within. Alteplase was added to the system
   according to the maximum dose for clinical use, 0.028 mg/ml. Five
   experiments each were conducted for stasis and fibrin thrombi
   respectively. Both types were lysis tested for four and 24 hours each.
   Fluid samples and photographs were taken for dissolution evaluation.
   Results: Visual inspection of the fibrin thrombus showed clear
   dissolution. For the stasis thrombus, the 24 h experiment produced no
   discernible dissolution of the thrombi, while the thrombi investigated
   over the 4 h period fragmented into small pieces which did not dissolve
   entirely. D-dimer levels in the fibrin thrombus tests rose steadily
   through the alteplase treatment for both test durations (short test
   12800-25600 ng/ml, long test 25600-51200 ng/ml). For the short term
   stasis thrombus testing, D-dimer values rose similarly to the fibrin
   thrombus, but levels remained much lower (short test 1600-3200 ng/ml,
   long test >200 ng/ml). Long term stasis thrombus tests showed no
   significant rise in D-dimer levels. Discussion: Alteplase was successful
   in dissolving fibrin thrombi in our experimental setup. D-dimer analysis
   supported the visual impression. The fragmentation of stasis thrombi and
   D-dimer levels measured may be due to the drug's fibrinolytic effect.
   The amount of erythrocytes in a stasis thrombus may resist lysis and
   produce challenges in the clinical application of thrombus lysis
   treatment. With this setup we were able to examine the reaction of the
   LVAD thrombi to Alteplase. This information can be used to further
   optimise clinical lysis therapy.
   Objectives: Methylprednisolon pulse therapy was used in the initial
   phase of induction therapy in some patients. This study was conducted in
   order to examine the short and long term effect of methylprednisolone
   pulse therapy for the lupus nephritis treated with muti-target therapy.
   Methods: The retrospective study included 43 patients diagnosed with
   lupus nephritis receiving muti-target therapy in our center, including
   prednisone combined with MMF and tacrolimus. 19 patients received
   methylprednisolon pulse therapy in the initial phase of induction
   therapy, 24 patients only received prednisone combined with MMF and
   tacrolimus. The dose of methylprednisolonpulse therapy was intravenous
   injection 500mgx3 days and the following prednisone dose was
   0.8-1.0mg/kg. We compared the primary and secondary outcomes of the two
   groups. In the patients combined with acute renal injury (AKI) subgroup,
   we also compared the primary and secondary outcomes between the two
   groups. Results: In the primary outcome, the CR rates are similar
   between the two groups. We did not find significant difference in the
   total remission rate (either complete or partial) between the two groups
   (p=0.93). The same is true for the remission time (p=0.87). There was no
   significant difference in the time and number of patients entering
   hemodialysis between the two groups (p=0.65). Although, in the AKI
   subgroup, there was a significant difference in the serum creatinine
   between the two groups in 1 month (P=0.045). However, there was no
   significant difference in the following up, and the probability of
   achieving CR and replase (calculated by using the Kaplan - Meier method)
   also had no significant difference. Discussion: Methylprednisolon pulse
   therapy seemed to have no significant effect on the long-term prognosis
   of lupus nephritis treated with muti-target therapy and it could not
   delay the patients' entry into hemodialysis. However, it may have had a
   better effect on the recovery of AKI patients and rapid relief of
   inflammatory reactions.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate intradialytic on-line
   multicomponent total removed solutes (TRS) monitoring in the spent
   dialysate, as potentially more objective parameter for removal of uremic
   solute markers urea, indoxyl sulfate (IS), and beta 2-Microglobulin
   (B2M) compared to relative indices as removal ratio, using a novel
   miniaturized optical sensor during hemodialysis (HD) and
   hemodiafiltration (HDF) with different settings. Methods: Ten ESKD
   patients (6 M and 4 F, 60.2 +/- 16.8 yrs) on chronic HDF were followed
   during 5 midweek dialysis sessions each (length 240min, HD: N=1,
   Qb=200ml/min, Qd=300ml/min, FX60; HDF: N=4, Qb > 300ml/min, Qd >
   500ml/min, Vsubst > 15l, FX800 and FX1000). Spent dialysate from the
   drain was monitored on-line by a miniaturized sensor prototype
   (Optofluid Technologies Ou, Estonia). For total dialysate collection
   method as the reference, a spent dialysate sample from the tank at the
   end of each dialysis session was taken. The concentrations of urea and
   B2M were determined in the clinical laboratory. Concentration of IS was
   determined utilizing the HPLC. Based on differences between laboratory
   and optical sensor TRS values BIAS and standard error (SE) were
   calculated. A t-test was used to determine significant differences (P <=
   0.05). Results: The average TRS values of optical sensor and laboratory
   were 510 +/- 86mM/L and 485 +/- 106mM/L for urea, 224 +/- 41mg/L and 228
   +/- 47mg/L for B2M, and 732 +/- 371 mu M/L and 719 +/- 392 mu M/L for
   IS, respectively. No statistical differences were found between optical
   and laboratory TRS values for any uremic solute. The relative BIAS +/-
   SE values of the TRS were -7.99 +/- 19.43\% for urea, 0.07 +/- 15.60\%
   for B2M, and -4.72 +/- 13.25\% for IS, respectively. Discussion: Novel
   miniaturized optical sensor successfully carried out intradialytic
   on-line multicomponent TRS monitoring in the spent dialysate.
   Objectives: Perioperative tight glycemic control (TGC) and management is
   of paramount importance during perioperative treatment of patients with
   multiorgan failure. Recent results have shown that such interoperative
   TGC led to an improvement of morbidity and mortality and to a prevention
   of Surgical site infection (SSI) in ICU patients. Consequently, a
   user-friendly device combining glucose analysis and delivery of glucose
   and insulin should allow for better therapies. Methods: Based on an
   already existing artificial pancreas device (STG-22), a new artificial
   endocrine pancreas system (STG-55) was developed. With a battery
   incorporated, it uses again a closed loop analytical system. Due to its
   in-built sensors, the closed-loop system allows for a quick and easy
   feed-back analysis of patient data through already established
   algorithms for glucose and insulin infusion. With the help of a
   disposable modular tubing circuit blood sampling from the patient's vein
   is realized and assessed by an automatically calibrated sensor. The
   device exhibits a maneuverable weight of only 36 kg and can be set-up
   within a single hour. Results: Clinical trials with STG-55, in Japan
   (Kochi University Hospital) have proven its re not sign liable
   practicability. Glucose monitoring was stable and results comparable to
   the analyses of an independent glucose analyzer with a high correlation
   coefficient. Due to appropriate insulin administration, no hypoglycemia
   was observed in patients under investigation. Discussion: The advent of
   new technological tools, such as miniaturized analytical devices in
   combination with the application of patient-specific precise algorithms
   allows for a strict and successful therapy without hypoglycemia in
   perioperative patients. With the new design and concept of STG-55, the
   set-up time for the artificial pancreas can be reduced down to 30\% of
   preexisting devices, which finally makes a glucose and insulin
   management in both the interoperative and the ICU user friendly.
   The generation of complex cellular structures for human application
   often requires a matrix, defining the three-dimensional shape and
   mechanical properties of the artificial tissue. The matrix as such is
   not viable. If this matrix is of human origin, Directive 2004/23/EC (in
   its national version) shall apply. In that case only
   ``non-substantial{''} processing methods may be utilized, which are
   specified in Regulation 1294/2007/EC. For example, non-cellular
   substances can be extracted from the tissue, so-called derivatives.
   These derivatives, if of human origin, are also tissues within the
   meaning of Directive 2004/23/EC. If these derivatives are further
   processed, or if the tissue originates from animals, the matrix is
   classified as a medical device. The Human Tissue Authority describes the
   delimitation as follows: ``Derivatives of non-viable tissues and cells
   such collagen fillers (i.e. collagen extracted from tissues and cells)
   fall under the Medical Device Regulation (MDR). Non-viable tissue and
   cell products such as demineralized bone matrix, or acellular human
   tissues or tissue matrices, will not be covered by the MDR. They will
   continue to fall under the Directive 2004/23/EC.{''} The paper deals in
   more detail with the problem of demarcation and describes the
   consequences of this in practice. We will discuss the problem of
   demarcation in more detail as well as describe the consequences in
   practical implementation.
   Objectives: In this study, two attempts of new biomaterial development
   based on the latest results of cell biology and tissue engineering are
   reported. One is specific cell separation using DNA as linker, and
   another is novel hybrid materials constructed by decellularized tissues
   complexed with synthetic polymer. Methods: Antibody was immobilized via
   desthiobiotin-avidin interaction. Single strand DNA (20mer) was
   chemically immobilized on the surface and then antibody (anti-mouse
   CD45, mCD45) modified with the complementary single strand DNA was
   immobilized on the surface through DNA duplex formation. Decellularized
   porcine dermis was prepared and lyophilized. After that, methyl
   methacrylate (MMA) monomer were immersed in stages, then polymerization
   was proceeded. The obtained hybrid material was analyzed by tensile
   strength and SEM observation. Results: Cells were also adhered on the
   surface at 37 degrees C and detached by 4 degrees C incubation with
   remaining cells that interacted with the surface via antibody-antigen
   interaction. The adhered cells were released by DNase treatment. These
   results suggest that cells can be selectively captured and collected by
   using the surface that immobilizes an antibody via dissociation
   molecules. The monomer absorption depends strongly on the tissue
   structure. Gradient-type decellularized dermis-poly(methyl methacrylate)
   complex was prepared by controlling the permeation time of the methyl
   methacrylate monomer. The mechanical strength of this complex gradually
   increased from the dermis side to the polymer side. Discussion:
   Developing new biomaterials combining new knowledge among different
   science discipline is an indispensable methodology for the next
   generation of medical development. The materials presented here are
   example of these biomaterials, and show the direction of future
   biomaterial development.
   Objectives: This investigation discusses the method of electrical
   stimulation of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)
   and skin fibroblasts (FB) growing on substrates composed by carbon
   nanotubes and organic compounds. Methods: Substrates were produced from
   a water dispersion of single-walled carbon nanotubes and organic
   compounds (serum albumin, collagen, chitosan) and formed by evaporation
   of the liquid component using infrared laser radiation. Laser exposure
   stimulated the formation of conductive nanotube clusters responsible for
   electrical signal transmission to the cells, and organic compounds
   improved cell adhesion due to the presence of cell membrane receptors
   sensitive to matrix proteins and aminosugar molecules. An aseptic system
   for electrical cell stimulation included an electric pulse generator,
   culture plate with cells with a breadboard and electrodes made of
   surgical steel with gold plating. Cells were stimulated for 48 hours
   with pulsed electric signal (60-200 mV amplitude, 1 ms pulse duration, 1
   s pause) directly inside the CO2-incubator. Results: The effects of
   electrical stimulation on the cell proliferation were estimated by
   MTT-test. It was found that both MSC and FB are sensitive to the
   stimulus, but the most prominent increase of cell proliferation was
   detected at 80 mV pulse amplitude. In these conditions, a 13 and 16
   percent augmentation of cell growth rate was obtained for MSC and FB,
   respectively. Similar results (the formation of denser cell monolayer)
   were achieved by fluorescent microscopy of cell nuclei stained by
   ethidium bromide and fluorescein diacetate. No pathological changes in
   cell morphology were observed. Discussion: The obtained results suggest
   that MSC and FB growing on conductive substrates are sensitive to
   electrical stimulation. This observation can be explained by the
   activation of potential-controlled ion channels and the stimulation of
   metabolic processes that accelerate cell growth.
   Objectives: The Modular Extracorporeal Lung Assist System (ModELAS) is a
   highly compact, modular, fully integrated pump-lung. The device can be
   configured to provide adult low-flow extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R)
   (removal of 30-50\% of metabolic CO2), full adult respiratory support or
   full pediatric respiratory support. The modular design allows for the
   exchange of the 0.65 m(2) adult bundle and the 0.3 m(2) pediatric
   bundle, while all other device components are identical. These studies
   characterized the in vivo performance of the ModELAS for each
   application. Methods: In vivo device performance was evaluated in
   healthy sheep (n=4 7-day ECCO2R, n=6 30-day adult ECMO, n=3 7-day
   pediatric ECMO). Pediatric studies utilized a right atrium to pulmonary
   artery cannulation strategy while adult studies utilized a dual lumen
   cannula placed in the jugular vein. Animals were recovered and tethered
   within a pen. The target blood flow rate was 0.5 L/min for ECCO2R and
   2-3 L/min for the ECMO applications. Anticoagulation was achieved via
   continuous heparin infusion. Animal hemodynamics were measured hourly,
   and blood chemistry, gas transfer and plasma free hemoglobin (PfHb) were
   measured throughout each study. Results: All animals were recovered and
   9 animals completed the full study duration. Average CO2 removal during
   ECCO2R was 74 +/- 6 mL/min. Average adult and pediatric oxygenation was
   134 +/- 10 mL/min and 94 +/- 11 mL/min, respectively. Average PfHb was
   less than 25 mg/dL, with the exception of one study following an acute
   kidney injury. Early terminations were due to a pulmonary embolism, a
   hemothorax, an intra-bundle thrombus and a fractured cannula. Typical
   explanted devices exhibited minimal thrombus. When present, thrombi were
   primarily located at the bundle inlet surface and impeller pivot.
   Discussion: These studies are on-going, but demonstrate positive
   performance of the ModELAS across a clinically relevant respiratory
   support spectrum.
   Objectives: Various modes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with or
   without a pump have been used as a bridge to lung transplantation in
   clinical settings. We have started to develop a large animal model for
   testing newly developed artificial lungs that can be used as a long-term
   bridging device. Methods: A total of eight goats weighing 40-55 kg were
   used. A membrane lung (Capiox EBS (R), Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) accompanied
   by a centrifugal pump (Emersave (R), Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was connected
   to the pulmonary artery (PA) trunk for outflow, and the left atrial (LA)
   appendage for inflow. The PA pressure (PAP), systemic arterial pressure
   (AP), pre- and post-oxygenator pressures were monitored. The blood flow
   of the main PA and the membrane lung were monitored continuously by
   using an ultrasonic perivascular probe (Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca,
   NY). The blood flow to the membrane lung was maintained at around 2.0
   L/min during the trials. Results: Four out of eight goats did not
   survive because of initial surgical failures (N=2), and introducing air
   bubbles in the membrane lungs (N=2). Other four goats were successfully
   kept for device testing. Durations of the circuit run were 7, 16, 24,
   and 48 days with or without heparin infusions according to the
   experimental protocols. Mean AP and mean PAP at the recovery from the
   surgery were 81 +/- 16 mmHg and 19 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively. The PA flow
   rate was 4.4 +/- 0.5 L/min. Discussion: The animal model for testing
   long-term membrane lung application as PA-to-LA configuration has been
   established. The model makes it possible for us to assess artificial
   lungs in vivo setting for long-term with stable blood flow through the
   device.
   Objectives: The effectiveness of the inhaled drugs is strictly related
   to the areas which are reachable by the drug particles. Unless the
   particles reach the desired part of the bronchial tree, their influence
   might not meet the required expectations and consequently the disease
   progress might not be stopped. Therefore, the primary objective of this
   research was to analyze the airflow patterns and particles deposition of
   a standard inhaled drug, commonly used during the treatment of asthma,
   with the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The study was
   devoted to the analysis of the particles diameter influence on their
   deposition areas within the entire respiratory tract. Methods: Two
   patient-specific respiratory tract models, for 6 and 12-year-old
   patients, were reconstructed basing on the DICOM image sets obtained
   during the Computed Tomography Examinations. The reconstruction of the
   digital models was performed within the Mimics Research 20.0 program,
   whereas the meshes were prepared with the use of the Ansys ICEM package.
   Numerical analyses were carried out as stationary ones with the constant
   inflow of the particles of various diameters (within the range of
   1.0-50.0 mu m). Results: It was proven that depending on the particles
   size, their deposition within the respiratory tract varies
   significantly. The vast majority of the particles with diameters over 20
   mu m are gathered on the walls of the throat, whereas particles of
   diameters 5-15 mu m are accumulating mainly on the trachea walls,
   leaving the alveoli insufficiently supplied with the drug particles.
   Similar phenomena could be observed for both investigated cases of the
   reconstructed geometries. Discussion: The significant changes of the
   drug particle distribution resulting from the various diameters of the
   particles indicate that the inhaled drug size cannot be treated as
   negligible factor during the drug spraying. Improper distribution of the
   particles, i.e. their aggregation on the wall of the throat and trachea,
   might not inhibit the symptoms of the asthma.
   Objectives: The improvement of immunosuppressive strategies have
   signifigantly reduced the risk and mortality of cellular rejection after
   Heart Transplantation (HTx). Recently, Humoral Rejection and antibodies
   have been recognized as a major problem in the management of recipients
   during the follow-up. Methods: 23 patients out of more than 700
   recipients undergoing HTx and 6 undergoing retransplantation required
   techniques of apheretic medicine to manage Humoral Rejection episodes or
   to lead to transplant patients with Donor Specific Antibodies (DSA).
   Results: In our experience 4 patients were treated with photopheresis
   with excellent tolerability, no adverse event and no rejection episodes.
   Photopheresis was added on top of standard immunosuppressive therapy in
   patients requiring minimization of calcineurins due to other clinical
   conditions. 19 patients experiencing humoral rejection were treated
   alternatively with Plasma Exchange (8 patients) or with
   immunoadsorption. Plasma Exchange was preferred in acute patients
   requiring removal of inflammatory factors other than antibodies while
   Immunoabsorption was better tolerated and adopted to reduce the
   metabolic impact and coagulative disorders when the patient was more
   stable. Discussion: Apheretic Medicine has opened a new door and
   represents an efficient weapon in the armamentarium of an HTx center.
   The complexity of the management of this new diseased in frail patients
   highlights the need for a multidisciplinary group establishing the right
   treatment for every patient.
   Realheart TAH is designed to imitate the construction of the human heart
   in order to create a blood flow as natural as possible. Realheart TAH
   consists of two pumps, corresponding to the right and left side of the
   natural heart. It pumps blood from the left side and right side
   simultaneously in a synchronized manner. Each pump of the Realheart TAH
   consists of an atrium and a ventricle, with a valve cylinder in between.
   When the valve cylinder moves towards ventricle, the blood pumps out
   from the ventricle creating the systolic phase. The ventricle fills with
   blood when the valve cylinder moves towards the atrium creating a
   diastolic phase. The cardiac output of the Realheart TAH depends on the
   stroke length of the valve cylinder and the frequency of the movement.
   The left and right pump regulate cardiac output independently in order
   to coordinate the left/right flow balance of the circulatory system.
   Similar to natural heart, Realheart TAH is integrated into the
   circulatory system, which facilitates the uninterrupted blood flow to
   the atrium, when it pumps the blood out of the ventricle in pulses. The
   atrium is constructed with a compliance membrane to avoid blood suction
   from the veins during the systolic phase.
   Objectives: Pre-vascularized, fibrin-based implants that can be attached
   to the blood vessels in vivo are a promising solution to faster and more
   efficient vascularization of implants, to facilitate implant healing and
   survival. Here, low concentrated (up to 10mg/mL) fibrin hydrogels have
   been shown to promote tube formation of endothelial cells in co-culture
   with ASC. However, these fibrin hydrogels are fairly unstable and higher
   fibrin concentrations are necessary for implant fabrication. We
   investigated whether higher concentrated (20-40 mg/mL) fibrin hydrogels
   were suitable for tube formation and if perfusion of the hydrogels could
   support capillarization of a fibrin-based implant. Methods: Capillary
   formation of endothelial cells was tested in tube assays using fibrin
   concentrations of 1-30 mg/ml. Hydrogels were fabricated with
   cryoprecipitated fibrinogen from blood plasma that had been activated
   with thrombin. Gels were seeded with EC and ASC co-cultures, supplied
   with feeding medium containing pro-angiogenic factors, and cultivated
   for 7 days. Hydrogels with 40 mg/mL fibrin and pre-formed channels were
   cellularized with EC and ASC and perfused with feeding medium for 10
   days under continuous flow. Results: In tube assays, only concentrations
   of 1 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL fibrin were suitable for endothelial tube
   formation, which started after 2 days and peaked after 5 days in
   culture. Tubes were stable for the total assay duration of 7 days.
   However, under perfusion, fibrin gels of 40 mg/mL showed an
   endothelialized pore formation throughout the gel. Discussion:
   High-concentration fibrin hydrogels can successfully be capillarized by
   EC-ASC co-cultures and perfusion. In static conditions, only
   low-concentration fibrin hydrogels are suitable for tube formation. As
   the next step hydrogels of different concentrations are to be connected
   to fibrin vascular grafts and perfused as a whole implant construct
   using a custom-made flow chamber as mechanical support.
   Objectives: The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of the
   passage number and glucose concentration on viability of the human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultured in the culture flasks.
   Methods: The HUVEC were isolated from umbilical veins obtained by
   Caesarean section. Cells after the 2nd and 7th passage were seeded with
   density of 4,600 cells/cm2. Glucose concentration in the culture medium
   was kept constant at the normal (5 mM) or high (20 mM) level or was
   switched every 24 hours from normal to high level or vice versa for 7 or
   14 days. The cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi
   m) and activity of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed using
   the flow cytometry (with propidium iodide, JC1 and DCFDA test,
   respectively). The glucose uptake and lactate production was also
   monitored. Microscopic visualization of cells was made after fixation in
   formalin using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results: After 7 days of
   culturing in medium with normal, high and variable glucose concentration
   the cell viability was higher respectively by 5\%, 4\% and 4\% in the
   HUVEC passaged 7 times than in those passaged 2 times. After 14 days the
   differences were higher and equal to 21\%, 21\% and 31\%, respectively.
   After 7 days Delta psi m was higher 1.3, 3.2 and 2.6 times in HUVEC
   after 7th passage than those after 2nd one, which were cultured in
   medium with the normal, high and variable glucose level, respectively.
   The glucose uptake and the lactate production were higher after 14 days
   and similar for all passages. The ROS activity was lower after 14 days
   of culturing for all cultures. Microscopic visualization of cells did
   not show any morphological differences. Discussion: The obtained results
   show that the properties and phenotype of HUVEC after the second passage
   are closer to the properties and phenotype of native cells. The HUVEC
   after the 7th passage are better adapted to in vitro conditions
   deviating from physiological conditions.
   One of the pillars for a more patient oriented healthcare is found in
   patient individualised medicine. Custom-made implants tailored to the
   individual's specific requirements is one of the key elements herein to
   obtain better outcomes. However, the production of patient
   individualised implants is nowadays still often related to a high rate
   of manual processes, causing both high cost and long delivery periods.
   Technical innovations play a crucial role in introducing these patient
   individualised therapy options into clinical prac-tice. Advances in
   medical imaging and the evolution of new production technologies (e.g.
   additive manufacturing) build the basis for a time and cost effective
   production of implants of lot size one at industrial-scale level.
   Combining these aspects with digitalisation leads to the potential of a
   new era of patient individualised implants and appropriate business
   models. It is crucial to systematically review and adapt the data
   management and data processing throughout the entire value chain in
   order to achieve the goal of a more patient individualised care.
   Different tools are used to de-fine interfaces, actors, data types
   throughout the entire process and methods need to be established for the
   data pro-cessing itself. A digital process chain from diagnosis to the
   actual delivery of a custom-made implant to the hospital including the
   manufacturing process is established. The underlying principles and
   assumptions used are exemplarily shown. The digital process chain is
   used to pave the way from science into a successful business model and
   company, in order to introduce these patient individualised implants to
   achieve a better patient care. The use of technical and medical
   progresses in combination with digitalisation is used to obtain a new
   generation of patient individualised implants. The way from science to
   start-up within this field is presented.
   Objectives: There are currently no available noninvasive methods that
   allow for the simultaneous and reliable measure of cardiac output (CO)
   and pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the arterial tree. Both of those
   indices are important biomarkers of cardiovascular status. Methods:
   Radial pressure profiles were recorded using applanation tonometry in a
   group of healthy subjects (N=18) and hemodialysis patients (N=30).
   Recorded pulse waves were used to estimate patient-specific parameters
   of the mathematical model describing the blood flow in the system of 55
   major arteries. Calibration of the model with patient data allowed to
   calculate patient-specific CO and PWV between any two points in the
   arterial tree. In all of the patients and healthy subjects we performed
   additional measurements of PWV using ECG gated applanation tonometry at
   two arterial sites (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical) and CO using bioimpedance
   cardiography (PhysioFlow, Manatec Biomedical). Results: The model was
   able to reproduce all of the recorded pressure profiles with high
   accuracy (average relative error < 10\%). Model-estimated PWV highly
   correlated with the one measured using SphygmoCor device (R = 0.75,
   p-value < 0.001). Model-predicted CO also correlated with the one
   measured by the bioimpedance cardiography, but at a lower level (R =
   0.52, p-value <0.001). Discussion: Our study demonstrates that coupling
   a mathematical model with a single peripheral pressure profile has the
   potential to provide information about cardiovascular state that was
   previously only available when using more complicated methods.
   Objectives: The purpose of this work is the study of biocompatibility
   for samples of three-dimensional cellular and tissue engineering
   constructions for layer-by-layer repair of tissues of heart and blood
   vessels. Samples components are albumin, collagen and chitosan as
   matrices and carbon nanotubes as reinforcement. Three-dimensional
   structures are formed in layers by laser printing. Methods: The
   biocompatibility of the samples and layers of their components was
   evaluated after their incubation with endothelial cells for 72 hours.
   Cell morphology was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and quantitative
   analysis was performed using MTT-test and real-time cell analysis by
   means of electrical impedance monitoring. For in vivo studies, samples
   were implanted in breasts of laboratory birds. Results: It has been
   established that the layer consisting of albumin and nanotubes supports
   proliferation of cells the most. Moreover, all layers have surface
   properties that provide cell adhesion. Real-time cell analysis showed
   improved cell proliferation compared to control during the entire
   incubation time, however the greatest differences were observed after 25
   hours of incubation. The morphology of the cells on the samples
   corresponds to the morphology of the control cells. With implantation of
   samples in experimental animals, the absence of their toxicity was
   observed. Discussion: Samples of three-dimensional cellular and
   tissue-engineering structures are biocompatible because of
   characteristics of their components and suitable surface structure. The
   obtained samples can be used to repair damages in cardiovascular system.
   Due to the method of laser printing, samples can be made in any form,
   taking into account the features of the damaged area of tissues.
   Objectives: The blood flow rate is the only parameter that can be
   controlled during the operation of an intracorporeal membrane oxygenator
   that significantly influences the gas exchange rate. Due to anatomical
   size restrictions, the catheter is of limited size and the tight
   packaging does not allow for placement of a dedicated flow rate sensor.
   Therefore, for a flow rate control system, the correct estimation of the
   blood flow rate is essential. In this work, a system specific flow rate
   estimation method is presented based on motor current and motor speed
   measurements. Methods: A training data set of motor current - I and
   rotational speed - omega, as well as volumetric flow rate - Q were
   recorded in an in-vitro model of the intracorporeal membrane oxygenator.
   A 40/60 water/glycerol mixture was used to approximate the dynamic
   properties of blood. The rotational speed of the motor was varied in a
   range of 10000 to 30000 RPM. For each motor speed, the hydraulic
   resistance of the system was varied with a throttle resulting in
   different flow rate values. Additionally, a test data set was acquired
   consisting of different rotational speed, hydraulic resistance, and flow
   rate triplets. The I, omega and Q training data was used to construct a
   fitting surface of the type Q(I, omega) by a regularized cubic spline
   least-squares approximation method. The surface was defined in a grid of
   591x591 points with Imin=-70 mA, Imax=520 mA, omega min=500 RPM, omega
   max=30000 RPM. The test set of I - omega pairs was then used to predict
   Q by means of a nearest neighbor search in the modeled surface. Results:
   A correlation coefficient of r=0.96 was achieved between the estimated
   and measured flow rates of the water/glycerol mixture. Discussion: The
   strong correlation between estimated and measured flow rate suggests
   that sensorless flow rate control is possible.
   Objectives: Developing new bioinks that are able to meet the crucial
   requirements for 3D bioprinting of different tissues has emerged
   recently as an important topic in the field of biomaterials. In this
   work, linear chains of hyaluronic acid (HA) were hydrophobically
   modified using hexadecyl short chains. The rheological properties as
   well as the 3D printability were investigated. Methods: HA of Mw = 76.6
   kDa was hydrophobically modified by conjugation of parts of its primary
   hydroxyl groups with hexadecyl chains in two steps. The ratio of
   substitution was determined using 1HNMR spectroscopy. Two different
   hydrogels were prepared at polymer concentration of 0.4 and 1.6 wt\%.
   The rheological properties of both hydrogels were investigated using
   continuous flow experiment and cyclic strain time sweep experiment.
   Furthermore, the 3D printability of the hydrogels was studied using an
   extrusion-based 3D printer. Results: 1H NMR spectrum of the new product
   revealed that the substitution ratio was 40 mol\%. Furthermore, the
   modified polymer was able to form sable hydrogels at both polymer
   concentrations whereas unmodified HA was unable to form hydrogel at the
   same concentrations. The rheological experiments showed decreasing of
   hydrogels viscosity by increasing the shearing rate which points toward
   a shear thinning property. Both hydrogels showed sharp decreases in the
   storage moduli upon applying high strains. The hydrogel prepared using
   2.6 wt\% of the modified polymer showed, however, higher shape-fidelity
   for 3D printing compared to hydrogel at polymer concentration of 0.4
   wt\%. Discussion: Hydrophobic modification of HA using relatively short
   alkyl chains enables physical crosslinking between polymer chains to
   produce biocompatible and 3D-printable hydrogel using low concentration
   of modified polymer. The rheological properties suggest their
   suitability as ink for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting
   Objectives: High resolution imaging of living cells is impaired by
   artefacts introduced by chemical fixation and by the rapid movement of
   molecules during live cell imaging. We have therefore developed tools to
   cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope and image them by high- and
   super-resolution microscopy. However, the developed equipment is also
   applicable to investigate the process of cryopreservation. Methods: We
   have developed two different microscope cryo-stages that allow for
   continuous observation on the fluorescence microscope. One stage allows
   for relatively slow controlled cooling (<50 degrees C/min) and warming
   (<150 degrees C/min) of cells. It allows for medium exchange during
   cooling and warming and thus for change of concentration of
   cryoprotective agents. Due to the design of this microscope stage, oil
   immersion objectives can be used down to at least -45 degrees C. The
   second stage is designed to ultra-rapidly cool cells with >10000 degrees
   C/s to temperatures Results: We established a protocol to reversibly
   cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope stage. This permits to image
   physiological processes in the same living cells with practically
   unlimited acquisition time at consecutive points in time. This allowed
   for super-resolution imaging and microspectroscopy measurements, which
   were impeded at physiological temperatures, because of the dynamics of
   cellular molecules. The development of a device to ultra-rapidly
   cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope under continuous observation
   allowed for the investigation of cells, which have been
   cryo-arrested/vitrified within Discussion: The presented cryo-fixations
   methods enable a more precise measurement of molecular patterns and thus
   a better understanding of molecular organization in cells under
   physiological conditions. The developed microscopy stages should however
   also enable high- and super-resolution fluorescence imaging of molecular
   processes in cells during the process of cryopreservation.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to provide a general overview of the
   design challenges in the wireless powering of artificial organs, to
   develop a general design strategy for inductive powering units (IPU),
   and to design a prototype IPU for mid-power application with high-stable
   output characteristic. Methods: Artificial organs can benefit greatly
   from inductive wireless powering, but there are several major design
   challenges which must be overcome. The high energy transfer efficiency
   must be ensured. The IPU must tolerate coils misalignments. Tissue
   overheating must be avoided. Biocompatible materials must be used. Size
   and weight restrictions must be taken into account. Finally, patient
   body specifics should be considered. We have developed a new general
   design strategy in which all mentioned problems are addressed. The main
   feature is that we simultaneously optimize the inductive link and the
   schematics of the transmitter and the receiver and take the body
   specific elements (the thickness of the skin and the fat layer) into
   account. We have developed strictly formal procedures which can be
   implemented using software in computer-aided design procedures. Results:
   In order to test and verify our approach we have designed a prototype
   IPU. The design goal was set as follows: IPU must ensure output power in
   the range 0.45 horizontal ellipsis 0.55 W for the axial distance between
   the coils in the range 10 horizontal ellipsis 20 mm and the lateral
   misalignments up to 20 mm. The design goal was achieved. Several coil
   couples were used to adjust optimal energy transfer distance to the
   expected implantation depth. Measurements were performed in the air as
   well as with the samples of ``skin-fat{''} biological objects were
   performed. Discussion: We have developed and tested design strategy for
   biomedical IPU which can provide reliable design adjusted to the various
   requirements and the specific of the patient's body.
   Objectives: The HeartMate 3 (HM3, Abbott Laboratories, USA) and
   HeartWare HVAD (Medtronic Inc., USA) clinically revealed a significantly
   different thrombogenic profile. In detail, while the HM3 has abated
   incidence of pump thrombosis, it was not associated with reduced stroke
   incidence. We numerically characterized and compared prothrombotic flow
   characteristics of the two pumps to provide mechanistic insights into
   observed clinical outcomes. Methods: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   simulations were performed to evaluate flow fields associated with
   periodic speed modulation in the two pumps (the artificial pulse for the
   HM3 and the Lavare cycle for the HVAD). One-way coupling to a lumped
   parameter model of the cardiovascular system was employed to account for
   physiologic boundary conditions. Results were compared to baseline
   simulations with constant pressure head and rotor speed to
   comprehensively evaluate geometrical and speed modulation effects.
   Analysis of the thrombogenic potential was based on calculation of: i) a
   specific platelet activation marker, the Platelet Activity State (PAS),
   using time course of viscous and Reynolds stress computed on platelet
   trajectories probed using Lagrangian particle tracking, ii) scalar
   washout, iii) volumes of flow stagnation, and iv) wall shear stress
   patterns. Results: The HM3 and HVAD showed different PAS distribution.
   Speed modulation was associated with increased sum of viscous and
   Reynolds stresses and PAS magnitude. Analysis of temporal and spatial
   gradients of the shear stress histories calculated on platelet
   trajectories, volumes of stagnation, and wall shear stresses allowed
   identification of geometrical and operating parameters that might
   contribute to pump thrombogenicity and pump washout Discussion: We
   compared prothrombotic fluid dynamic features of the HM3 and HVAD under
   realistic dynamic operating conditions. Our results provide a
   ``numerical rationale{''} for the observed clinical outcomes.
   Objectives: Over time left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have become
   an alternative to heart transplantation because of enormous technical
   development and miniaturization. Implantation of these systems has been
   proven to lead to considerably improved survival, with an increase in
   quality of life. Following implantation, most patients display a
   considerable improvement in physical capacity, measured according to the
   New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, even though exercise
   tolerance levels following the implantation of an LVAD are still
   considerably restricted. Methods: Current state of scientific knowledge
   with respect to the physical capacity of patients with terminal heart
   failure after LVAD implantation is described at rest and during
   exercise. The significance of new diagnostic tools, such as the
   non-invasive inert gas rebreathing method for measurement of cardiac
   output and arteriovenous oxygen difference (AVDO2) in assessment of the
   performance of LVAD patients is discussed. Results: Pump flow across the
   LVAD can be increased to a certain degree during exercise and normal
   everyday activities via two mechanisms: exercise-dependent tachycardia
   and increase of enddiastolic pressure in the left ventricle in
   conjunction with increased preloading. The share of the native left
   ventricle in systemic perfusion can also increase during exercise. Here,
   left-ventricular pressure exceeds systemic blood pressure and the aortic
   valve opens. The contractile reserve of the myocardium does, of course,
   play a crucial role. Discussion: Ultimately, the cardiopulmonary
   capacity of LVAD patients is restricted to a higher degree during
   exercise, even after implantation. Larger studies are required to
   clarify the extent to which longer-term physical exercise training after
   discharge from rehabilitation and/or an increase in the number of pump
   rotations can lead to increased physical capacity in LVAD patients.
   Objectives: The epidemiology of heart failure (HF) is a rising medical
   burden with an estimated growing rate of 46\% from 2012 to 2030. Left
   Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD) and minimally invasive techniques are
   nowadays key therapies to guarantee optimal treatments for each HF
   patient. So far, clinical experience with minimally-invasive LVAD
   surgery showed promising short-term results. The aim of this study is to
   evaluate the long-term results of the first series of patients who
   received minimally-invasive LVAD surgery at our institution. Methods: We
   reviewed the short and long term outcomes of 111 end-stage HF patients
   who received an LVAD implantation (HVAD, HeartWare, Medtronic, USA) at
   our institution between 2011 and 2014. All patients underwent an upper
   hemisternotomy and left-sided anterolateral thoracotomy with
   cardiopulmonary bypass. Results: Between 2011 and 2014, 111
   minimally-invasive LVAD implantations were performed at our institution
   (78\% male, 22\% female; mean age 52 +/- 4; dilated cardiomyopathy
   42.6\%; ischaemic cardiomyopathy 44.4\%, other aetiologies 13\%).
   Postoperative bleeding incidence was 9.6\% leading to a low amount of
   applied packed red blood cells (mean: 4.9 rbc), short ICU stay (mean 9.3
   days), and a low incidence of right heart failure (4.6\%). Thirty-day
   mortality was 5.2\%, 90-day mortality 9.0\% and 1-year survival 88\%.
   Long-term follow-up (median 6.4 years) demonstrated a mortality of
   51,4\%, a transplant rate of 16.4\%, and an explant rate of 1,7\%.
   15.8\% of patients underwent pump exchange and 30,3\% of patients had
   still an ongoing LVAD therapy at the time of follow-up. Discussion:
   Minimally-invasive LVAD implantations are proven to be safe and
   associated with a lower perioperative complication and mortality rate.
   By using an upper hemisternotomy with an anterolateral thoracotomy, the
   intra-hospital outcomes showed promising results impacting also the
   long-term follow-up which presented an excellent percentage of ongoing
   LVAD therapies.
   Objectives: Quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) provides fast and
   label-free analysis of living cells by minimized interaction with the
   sample. The analysis of QPM images enables the determination of
   morphological cell parameters like cell thickness and elongation and
   facilitates single cell tracking for migration analysis. Methods: To
   demonstrate the potential of QPM in determining the metastatic potential
   of cells, we have developed a fully automated QPM system utilizing
   digital holographic microscopy (DHM) in an off-axis Mach-Zehnder
   configuration. Different pancreatic tumor cell lines, beating heart
   cells, white blood cells and in vitro toxicology models were analyzed
   for refraction index, cell volume, cell area, dry mass and cell
   morphology dependent processes. Results: The morphological analysis of
   the different cell lines via QPM in combination with image
   segmentation-based evaluation of the retrieved quantitative phase images
   showed that QPI could identify and quantify cell types and cellular
   processes by cell specific properties as cell proliferation, cell death,
   3D cell migration or cell height. E. g. cells with a high metastatic
   potential had a lower cell thickness and a higher elongation than cells
   with a low metastatic potential. Moreover, computer assisted tracking of
   single cells showed that highly metastatic cells covered a longer
   distance and had a higher motility compared to cells with a low
   metastatic potential. Also white blood cell types and disease or drug
   induced morphological blood cell alterations could be separated.
   Discussion: In summary, the multi-functional potential of QPM in various
   cell biological applications as cancer cell or stem cell research,
   toxicological and pharmacological screenings and cell quality control
   represents a promising new approach for a fast and label free
   phenotyping of different cell types and cellular processes. QPM meets
   the growing interest in label-free, optical techniques minimizing
   samples interaction.
   Objectives: Severe life-threatening thrombocytopenia may be caused by
   exceptionally wide range of clinical conditions. Currently, donor
   platelet (PLT) transfusion is the only efficient clinical approach to
   successfully treat thrombocytopenia. However, PLT transfusion is
   challenged by adverse immune responses and is limited the short shelf
   life of donated material. Previously, we showed the feasibility to
   generate iPSC-derived MKs in a large scale, which can be used as an
   alternative to conventional PLT transfusion. However, success of this
   perspective therapeutic approach requires efficient biobanking
   technologies that would allow long-term storage and accumulation of MKs
   in clinically sufficient amounts. In this study, we aimed at the
   development of an optimal biobanking strategies for the preservation of
   iPSC-derived MKs. Methods: Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and
   propane-1,2-diol (PD) were evaluated for their cryoprotective efficiency
   in iPSC-derived MKs. Comprehensive phenotypic characterization of MKs
   before and after cryopreservation was performed by fluorescence
   microscopy and flow cytometry. Capability of cryopreserved MKs to form
   proPLTs and release functional PLTs has been tested in vitro.
   Transfusion into animal model has been performed to evaluate capability
   of MKs to release PLTs in vivo. Results and Discussion: Application of
   developed cryopreservation procedures allowed recovery of over 80\% of
   iPSC-derived MKs cryopreserved with Me2SO and PD. Recovered cell
   populations expressed typical MK markers, including CD41, CD61, and
   CD42a and showed high polyploidy. Moreover, cryopreserved MKs showed the
   capability to form proPLTs and release PLTs in vitro as well as in vivo
   after transfusion in animal model. Present findings propose efficient
   clinically relevant biobanking strategies necessary for progress in
   MK-based regenerative and replacement approaches.
   Objectives: Adverse events due to flow-induced blood damage remain a
   serious problem for blood pumps as cardiac support systems. The
   numerical prediction of blood damage via computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) is a helpful tool for the design and optimization of reliable
   pumps. Blood damage prediction models primarily are based on the acting
   shear stresses, which are calculated by solving the Navier-Stokes
   equations on computational grids. The purpose of this paper is to
   analyze the influence of the spatial discretization and the associated
   discretization error on the shear stress calculation in a blood pump in
   comparison to other important flow quantities like the pressure head of
   the pump. Methods: CFD analysis using seven Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged
   Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations were performed. Two simple stress
   calculation indicators were applied to estimate the influence of the
   discretization on the results using an approach to calculate numerical
   uncertainties, which indicates discretization errors. Results: For the
   finest grid with 19 million elements, numerical uncertainties up to 20
   \% for shear stresses were determined, while the pressure heads show
   smaller uncertainties with a maximum of 4.8 \%. Discussion: No
   grid-independent solution for velocity gradient-dependent variables
   could be obtained on a grid size that is comparable to mesh sizes in
   state-of-the-art blood pump studies. It can be concluded that the grid
   size has a major influence on the shear stress calculation, and
   therefore the potential blood damage prediction, and that the
   quantification of this error should always be taken into account.
   Objectives: The piezoelectric effect of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
   is a promising property to be considered when controlling the diffusion
   of ions through membranes. This study examines the impact of different
   solvents and their ratios on the piezoelectric beta-phase of PVDF and on
   the diffusion rates of fiber membranes. Methods: Fiber mats were
   polarized via electrospinning using 20w\% PVDF solutions with solvent
   mixtures of dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethylacetamide (DMAc) as first
   solvent and acetone or methyl acetate (MeOAc) as second solvent in
   different ratios. Conversion of non-polar alpha-phase into polar
   beta-phase was evaluated via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FTIR). Diffusion experiments were performed by measuring changes in
   conductivity of deionized water (1.5 mu S/cm) for 150min under static
   and cyclic loading conditions. Results: Polymer solutions showed a
   non-Newtonian behavior. An increasing acetone ratio led to decreasing
   densities in PVDF solutions. Densities remained unchanged for all MeOAc
   ratios. FTIR results for MeOAc-solubilized PVDF fiber mats showed lower
   intensity of alpha-phase peaks at 762cm(-1) as compared to acetone
   solubilized ones. The intensity of the characteristic 840cm(-1) polar
   beta-phase peak rose with a higher ratio of the second solvent.
   Diffusion experiments with piezoelectric PVDF membranes (n=5) inhibited
   sodium chloride diffusion under static conditions (67 mu S/cm) while
   induction of the direct piezoelectric effect allowed for increased
   diffusion (533 mu S/cm). Discussion: Solvent properties and ratios
   influence the intrinsic properties of PVDF solutions for electrospinning
   and consequently affect beta-phase conversion. Especially, MeOAc in
   combination with DMF or DMAc has a positive effect on piezoelectric
   beta-phase conversion. With suitable process parameters, piezoelectric
   fiber mats can be produced for active filter membranes. Ongoing
   experiments aim to investigate their molecular weight cut-off
   properties.
   Objectives: A cochlear implant (CI) is an auditory neuroprosthesis used
   to restore hearing in deaf and profoundly deaf patients. It features an
   electrode array (EA) which needs to be inserted into the inner ear
   (cochlea) to enable electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve.
   Spatial proximity of the EA and the nerve fibers is considered
   beneficial. This requires a shape change of the initially straight EA to
   enclose the inner wall of the spiral-shaped inner ear after
   implantation. Thin wires made of Nitinol-a shape memory alloy (SMA)-are
   investigated regarding their applicability as embedded actuators to
   implement a shape change. Methods: Nitinol wires ( null 100 mu m) have
   been trained to a spiral shape which was derived from cross-sectional
   images of a human specimen as an exemplary adaption to a specific
   cochlea geometry. Ten different variations of thermomechanical
   processing were applied by the supplier (G.RAU GmbH \& Co. KG) to tailor
   the shape memory effect to the application specific requirements. In
   order to determine the resulting transformation temperatures (AS, AF) a
   bend and free recovery (BFR) test suitable for curved wires was
   developed and utilized. Results: It is possible to design and fabricate
   spiral-shaped SMA wires which fit to a specific cochlea shape. The
   developed BFR test setup allows for measuring the thermomechanical
   properties of these actuators in an application oriented manner. This
   provides slightly higher but more realistic measures for AS and AF
   compared to differential scanning calorimetry. Discussion: A complete
   design, manufacturing and validation process for thin spiral shape
   memory wires could be established. The next step is to integrate these
   wires into an EA and perform BFR measurements again as it is known that
   external forces due to stiffness of the EA alter the transformation
   temperatures.
   Objectives: The purpose of the work is to develop a theoretical basis
   for determining the thickness of the laminar boundary layer in the nasal
   cavity during respiration. Methods: Methods for obtaining basic
   scientific and practical results are based on the general principles of
   theoretical physics and aerodynamics in order to determine the laminar
   boundary layer of air flow in the upper respiratory tract. Results:
   Using the aerodynamic approach to the study of respiratory and olfactory
   disorders revealed that the thickness of the laminar boundary layer
   decreases with decreasing equivalent diameter of the nasal cavity and
   with increasing Reynolds number, which characterizes the degree of
   turbulence in the air flow. Typical values of the thickness of the
   laminar boundary layer are in the range of 0.2-0.05 mm, depending on the
   mode of nasal breathing and the configuration of the nasal cavity. The
   data obtained characterizes the effect of airflow on the mucous membrane
   of the nasal cavity: if the heterogeneity of the mucosal surface extends
   beyond the boundary of the laminar boundary layer, then such portions of
   the nasal cavity are exposed to turbulent flow, which leads to
   overdrying. The size of the heterogeneities of the mucosa is determined
   by tomographic data during their processing at the sub-pixel level,
   which allows for the investigation of the effect of the intensity of the
   boundary elements of the walls of the nasal passages. Discussion: A
   model of the distribution of airflow velocities in the nasal cavity in
   the turbulent mode is proposed; it has a logarithmic or power profile
   cross section, and within the laminar boundary layer the air velocity
   increases linearly to almost the max value. The current air velocity in
   the cross sections amounted to 5-7 m/s. The feature of the developed
   method is transitioned to hydraulic diameter, which takes into account
   complex configuration of the nasal cavity, as well as an anatomically
   narrow area - the olfactory slit.
   Objectives: Bioengineering of elements of the musculo-skeletal system is
   rich in studies concerning bone reconstruction. Among them, the culture
   of cells on a osteogenic electrospun scaffold under dynamic conditions
   is an interesting option. However, one should also consider the
   reconstruction of tendon and muscle finally mimicking a continuum from
   bone to muscle. Methods: Poly-caprolactone (PCL) 10\% was electrospun on
   a rotating collector whose velocity varied to get random or aligned
   nanofibers. Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and C2C12 cells were
   respectively seeded on the materials. Mechanical or electrical stresses
   were applied to the biohybrid scaffolds to differentiate cells towards
   tendon's or muscle's phenotypes, in the absence any specific biochemical
   factors. Results: After 2 weeks of culture under dynamic stretching
   (1Hz, 4\% strain for an hour followed by 11h of rest), BMSCs were found
   to align in the stretching direction, presented increased levels of
   tenomodulin and neosynthetized collagen, compared to static conditions.
   C2C12 differentiation until aligned myotubes stage was more difficult to
   achieve. We proposed to add a PEG microstructure to guide cell growth.
   Combined to electrical stimulation, it led to the cells fusion into very
   long myotubes hosting many nuclei, as expected. Discussion: In this
   study, we managed to grow two different types of cells and generate
   their differentiation towards tendon and muscle lineage, in the absence
   of any differentiation factors. The next step is to implement the
   co-culture on different areas of the same electrospun scaffold, to let
   the cells proliferate and study the events occurring at the junction.
   Objectives: Alarm fatigue is a safety and quality problem where exposure
   to high rates of clinical alarms results in desensitization leading to
   cognitive bias or slowed response to alarms. One reason for alarm
   fatigue is false pressure alarms during extracorporeal blood therapies.
   It is clear that current machine algorithms based on simple threshold
   monitoring must be replaced by intelligent algorithms that avoid any
   false positive alarm. Methods: Detailed analysis of arterial pressure,
   venous pressure, transmembrane pressure, ultrafiltration rate and
   relative blood volume during hemodialysis was performed using a patient
   data base. Main causes of pressure alarms were identified, analysed and
   replicated during simulated hemodialysis therapies with a FMC 4008
   hemodialysis device and a patient simulator. Results: Data analysis
   shows clear evidence that even slowly drifting adaptive baseline alarms
   which are currently in use lead to false positive alarms with a high
   probability during nearly every treatment. Pressure variations which are
   induced by local flow and blood viscosity changes can be identified
   reliably by use of algorithms based on pattern recognition. Pressure
   variations from patient movements and changes in blood pressure show a
   different pattern that can be used to distinguish between true alarm
   events and false positive events. Discussion: For 25 years, it has been
   known that alarm systems which monitor whether a threshold value is
   exceeded have a rate of false alarms of 77-99,5\% depending on the
   physiologic parameter monitored (Wiklund et al., 1994). New adaptive
   algorithms based on pattern recognition principles help to combine both
   maximum patient safety and avoidance of false positive pressure alarms.
   Objectives: In vivo tissue engineered vascular tissues ``Biotubes{''}
   constructed in the subcutaneous spaces of the recipients exhibited
   superior functions. However, since the formation of the vascular tissues
   depends on the recipient conditions, chemical pretreatments such as
   dehydration by ethanol (ET) or crosslinking by glutaraldehyde (GA) were
   attempted to improve their initial mechanical durability. Last year, we
   reported that ET and GA increased the burst pressure of the tissues and
   did not affect their suture retention strength. This year, we measured 3
   parameters of mechanical properties: ultimate tensile strength (UTS),
   ultimate strain (\%) and Young's modulus. Methods: Tubular tissues (ID:
   5 mm) constructed in the subcutaneous tissues of beagle dogs (4 weeks,
   n=3) were separated to the 3 groups, raw tissue group with no treatments
   (RAW), that under dehydration with 70\% ET (ET) for 10 min and
   crosslinking with 0.6\% GA (GA) for 10 min. We measured 3 parameters
   shown above, by tissue ringlet pull test. Results: There were no
   significant differences in UTS (RAW: 3.765 +/- 0.662 MPa, ET: 4.330 +/-
   0.619 MPa, GA: 3.763 +/- 0.438 MPa, p=0.409) or ultimate strain (RAW:
   30.15 +/- 1.60 \%, ET: 41.22 +/- 6.11 \%, GA: 37.73 +/- 4.36 \%,
   p=0.209) between the 3 groups. Young's modulus of ET group was
   significantly higher among the 3 groups (RAW: 5.41 +/- 1.16 MPa, ET:
   12.28 +/- 2.55 MPa, GA: 7.65 +/- 1.18 MPa, p= 0.0289). Discussion: Short
   period of chemical treatment using ET and GA might make it possible to
   control the mechanical properties of in vivo tissue engineered vascular
   tissues to produce the ideal grafts in mechanical aspects.
   Objectives: Stent graft development is one of the most important topics
   for countries with a large number of elderly people. However, very
   little research has been carried out using model circulation of the
   aortic dissection. Quantitative evaluation and development have been
   difficult, because there was no model. Methods: In this study, a fluid
   dynamical circuit model circulation simulating the left heart
   circulation of the dissecting aortic aneurysm was developed with a
   pulsatile blood pump. Various shapes of the inflow side and outflow side
   for the pseudo lumen were used in the experimental series. Furthermore,
   an animal model of the dissecting aneurysm was developed using a
   mechanical dissecting method and flow patterns of the animal aortas with
   the model dissecting aneurysm, after the ethical committee's approval.
   Flow and pressure pattern time series data was recorded in the digital
   recorder and a quantitative evaluation was carried out. Results: Flow of
   the true lumen and pseudo lumen was divided with a thin membrane.
   Various amounts of the flow and pressure was observed and recorded.
   Membrane of the dissecting aortic aneurysm was simulated with rubber
   sheet. After the insertion of the aortic stent, the shapes of the flow
   and pressure pattern were altered. Animal experiments to develop the
   dissecting aneurysm were difficult. Firstly the aorta of the goats was
   removed, and then the dissecting aneurysm was to be constructed by the
   detachment of the tunica media of the aortic wall. Flow pattern of the
   experimental Aorta was recorded. Discussion: Quantitative evaluation of
   the Aortic Stent expanding performance and pressure and flow pattern in
   the true and pseudo lumen had been observed in the mock circulation
   loop. Furthermore, animal model of the dissecting aorta will be useful
   material for the development of the stent graft in the near future.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to investigate the performance of
   the RealHeart (TM)psi total artificial heart (TAH) with a hybrid cardiac
   simulator (HCS). Methods: The HCS, developed at the Nalecz Institute of
   Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, is a computational-hydraulic
   model of the cardiovascular system. Four hydro-numerical interfaces
   reproduced the pressure/flow profiles of atria, pulmonary artery, and
   aorta hydraulically, while the rest of the circulation was numerical.
   The TAH was connected accordingly. The TAH is a pulsatile 4-chamber
   device whose left and right sides can operate independently, by changing
   pulse rate (PR) and stroke length (SL). The TAH was tested on the HCS at
   low/medium operating points: PR 60/80/100/120 bpm; SL 20/22/24/26 mm;
   systole duration ratio 0.4 of the TAH cycle. Systemic resistance was
   changed between 0.8 and 1.2 mmHg/(ml/s), pulmonary resistance was
   changed between 0.1 and 0.2 mmHg/(ml/s). Systemic and pulmonary
   compliances were set to 1.4 ml/mmHg. Results: The independent tuning of
   PR and SL permits fine regulation the TAH flow on the left and right
   sides. As an example, for a peripheral resistance of 1.0 mmHg/(ml/s) the
   flow ranged from 2.7 l/min (PR=60,SL=20mm) to 7.0 l/min
   (PS=120,SL=26mm). For the investigated PRs and SLs, power consumption on
   the left pump ranged between 1.3 and 10.0 Watts and on the right pump
   between 0.9 and 6.0 Watts. The TAH provides a pulsatile flow, whose
   waveform depends on the SL and systole duration. This induced a pressure
   pulsatility ranging from 10mmHg (PR=60,SL=20mm) to 38 mmHg
   (PR=120,SL=26mm) in both the aorta and pulmonary artery. Discussion: The
   HCS is a flexible test bench to evaluate the TAH performance in
   different hemodynamic conditions. The tuning of PR and SL on the left
   and right side of the TAH, independently, offers flexibility in
   regulating cardiac output and in managing the left/right flow balance.
   Power consumption is in the range suitable for clinical applications.
   Objectives: In case of chronic mechanical circulatory support, it is
   highly desirable to fully understand the interaction between the beating
   left ventricle and the VAD in order to potentially reduce adverse
   events. Thus, we took the VAD's perspective and investigated the flow
   inside a VAD in an advanced development status during the time course of
   a heartbeat. Methods: The study is conducted with computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) applying realistic pressure boundary conditions for left
   ventricular and arterial pressure and the results are compared to
   results produced with an established, active mock circulation loop. Due
   to the high resolution in time and space and the use of sliding mesh
   interfaces, local flow phenomena during different phases of systole and
   diastole are unmasked. The effects of inertia in the pump and cannulae
   become evident, which are not modeled in more traditional VAD flow
   simulations with steady-state boundary conditions. Results: The results
   show that hysteresis effects due to inertia are quantitatively of high
   importance. The hysteresis curves of the VAD operational point obtained
   experimentally and numerically correlate well. Moreover, the results
   show that a VAD design for a highly pulsed flow can lead to a situation,
   where almost no remaining stagnation zones, as quantified with a
   numerical stagnation index, exist during a heartbeat. Discussion:
   Despite increased computational costs, highly resolved CFD simulations
   in time and space with realistic time-varying boundary conditions are a
   powerful tool to increase understanding of the interaction of the
   mechanically supported circulation and the device itself. This enabled a
   verification of a VAD design with low to almost non-existing flow
   stagnation at constant rotational speed. This finding correlates well
   with the fact that the VAD does not require any anticoagulation in
   chronic animal trial testing lasting weeks to months.
   Objectives: The friction properties for the contact between contact
   lenses and the eyelid are the focus of current research in order to
   optimize the wearing comfort. The tribological system consisting of
   contact lense, eyelid and tear fluid should be considered. Suitable
   measurement conditions must be used for the examinations. Methods: In
   this research the nano- and microtribological friction properties of
   hard and soft (hydrogel) contact lenses were investigated. The friction
   conditions were investigated by nano scratch test; moreover, a
   nanotribometer was used to evaluate the frictional properties during
   sliding on the lenses. Contact lens fluid was applied as lubricant for
   both cases. Results: The friction coefficients of hard contact lenses
   and hydrogel lenses were detected for a range of speeds and loads. It
   was possible to examine the differences of the both contact lenses in
   detail. For the nano scratch and friction tests, there is a dependency
   of speed and normal force. Discussion: In case of nano-scratch tests,
   the frictional properties were investigated wile ploughing. This case
   shows the elastic- and plastic material properties besides the friction.
   In the case of the frictional tests, the measuring tip slides without
   ploughing. Due to the lubrication conditions, the soft hydrogel lenses
   feature a much lower friction coefficient. In case of the hard contact
   lenses, the coefficient of friction is comparable to the nano scratch
   test, as there is no lubrication film between both measuring tips and
   the contact lens. For further work it is mandatory to work under
   standazdized measurement conditions.
   Objectives: Patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) show an
   increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity mainly due to the
   accumulation of protein-bound uremic retention solutes. Dialysis
   therapies have been optimized for the removal of low-molecular weight
   water-soluble and unbound uremic retention solutes, but not for
   protein-bound uremic retention solutes. Therefore, there is a strong
   need to increase the portion of unbound fractions in order to increase
   the clearance for these uremic toxins. Methods: We developed dialysis
   techniques where the protein-bound uremic retention solutes are removed
   more efficiently under high ionic strength or high-frequent electric
   fields. The protein integrity of proteins and enzymatic activities were
   analysed. Results: The protein-bound fraction of phenylacetic acid,
   indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate was significantly decreased by
   using high ionic strength or high-frequent electric fields Discussion:
   Although protein-bound uremic retention solutes have a major impact on
   the morbidity and mortality of CKD patients, the clearance of these
   solutes by conventional extracorporeal therapies is low until now. These
   uremic toxins bind to plasma proteins with a molecular weight greater
   than the cut-off of dialysis membranes and therefore conventional
   dialysis therapies do not sufficiently remove protein-bound uremic
   toxins. Disruption of association with protein and uremic solute is one
   possibility to significantly improve the removal of protein-bound uremic
   toxins. Therefore, we developed approaches for an increased release
   protein-bound uremic retention solutes from their protein-binding
   resulting in an increased clearance. Conclusion: Improvements of
   therapies for CKD patients are essential. Especial the consideration of
   removing hydrophobic protein-bound uremic toxins via new methods like
   application of high-electric fields or increased ionic strength is a
   further progress
   Objectives: Tissue decellularization is one of the novel techniques in
   tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for obtaining extracellular
   matrix, which doesn't preserve mechanical properties of native tissue.
   Modified by the extracellular matrix, silk fibroin scaffolds can combine
   high biocompatibility and suitable mechanical properties. Methods:
   Wistar rats were used as liver donors. Decellularization of liver tissue
   was performed by sequential incubation with three solutions of 0,1\% SDS
   containing Triton X-100 in the following concentrations: 1\%, 2\% and
   3\%. Livers were ground in liquid nitrogen and a certain fraction of
   microparticles was separated by precipitation and centrifugation. Silk
   fibroin scaffolds were prepared by a casting method using water as a
   solvent. Microparticle suspension was blended with fibroin solution
   before film preparation. Scaffold structure was investigated by scanning
   probe nanotomography (SPM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The
   cytotoxicity of scaffolds, cell adhesion and proliferation were
   evaluated. Modified scaffolds were used as wound coatings in a
   full-thickness skin wound model. Results: Microparticles with a size
   less than 5 mu m were prepared from decellularized liver tissue.
   Modified silk fibroin scaffolds were obtained. Sinuous and rough
   topography of the obtained matrix was shown. The produced scaffolds did
   not show cytotoxic effect. The cells adhesion was significantly higher
   on scaffolds modified with decellularized liver tissue microparticles in
   comparison with non-modified scaffolds. Modified silk fibroin scaffolds
   promoted skin wound regeneration by 30\% in comparison with non-modified
   scaffolds. Discussion: Regenerative potential of extracellular matrix as
   microparticles was shown. Decellularization of organs and tissues may be
   used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for increasing the
   biocompatibility of the artificial grafts.
   Hemodialysis is an important therapy for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
   patients if a donor kidney is not available. During four hours of
   conventional therapy, three times a week, mainly small water-soluble
   toxins and a limited number of middle molecules are effectively removed
   from the patients' blood {[}1]. Besides, the therapy is non-continuous,
   causing large fluctuations in water balance and uremic waste, potassium
   and phosphate. Therefore, in recent years, many developments are
   focussed on longer treatment times, such as, nocturnal dialysis or
   application of a portable or wearable artificial kidney (PAK or WAK
   respectively). The continuous therapy outside the hospital requires
   application of membranes with long-term selectivity, fouling resistance
   and blood compatibility as well as demands reduced amount of water. In
   fact, for WAK, a small volume of spent dialysate should be continuously
   regenerated and reused. In this lecture, we will discuss all these
   important issues, including:
   Strategies for achieving endotoxin-free dialysate since the continuous
   recirculation of the dialysate for prolonged time demands additional
   efforts to avoid microbial contamination, without extra water
   consumption and without affecting the overall weight of the system.
   Strategies for achieving dialysate regeneration and especially urea
   removal since its daily molar production is higher than that of other
   waste solutes.
   Objectives: Ventricular assist devices are a commonly used therapy for
   end stage heart failure patients. Pump thrombosis is one of the most
   common problems in patients supported by an LVAD. Two types of thrombus
   can be distinguished: white thrombi and red thrombi. The only available
   option to combat a PT is a lysis therapy or a pump exchange. The
   objective of the presented study is to develop a relevant white pump
   thrombus model to promote development of these concepts. Methods: We
   developed an in vitro mock circulation system. The artificial blood
   circulation is provided by a HVAD. The HVAD pumps 80ml of human blood
   through the silicone loop. Parameters for inducing the white thrombus
   are high shear stress (4000 revolutions per minute), a rougher surface
   of the rotor, and an added activator of the intrinsic coagulation
   cascade. After two hours, the HVAD-system was checked for a white
   thrombus. Generated thrombi were stored for subsequent analysis
   (scanning electron microscopy and mechanical stability). Results:
   Thrombus generation was reproducible in number and geometry. After ten
   test runs, 23 thrombi were detected. All these generated thrombi had a
   minimal size of 12 mm(2). The developed thrombi are very similar in
   structure compared to white patient thrombi explanted in clinic. The
   scanning electron microscope showed a fibrin net on the surface of all
   tested thrombi (n=5). All tested thrombi samples (n=5) resist high
   strength (max. 1.029 MPa) in compression tests, which is typical for
   white PT. Discussion: The size of the thrombus should be increased for
   special investigational needs. A protocol was developed for reproducible
   and reliable production of white, shear induced thrombi for lysis
   therapy investigations. In addition, the similarity (biological
   structure, mechanical stability) to explanted patient thrombi was shown.
   However, additional analyses should be performed for further
   characterization of the artificial thrombi.
   Patient-specific anatomies can be reconstructed with a precision of
   approximately 0.5mm, using state of the art imaging modalities. This
   refers both to hard and soft tissues, hence with applications in
   clinical domains such as orthopedics, dentistry, cardiovascular surgery.
   Datamining techniques such as statistical shape modeling support the
   generation of biofidelic computer models. However, these models have to
   be fed with accurate data to reflect not only the geometry but also the
   material properties, the loading conditions and the interface between
   implants and bone in case of prosthetic reconstruction. The challenge is
   to optimize the interface between host tissue and implant in order to
   achieve maximum long-term functionality, but this optimization is also
   dependent on the optimization of the interfacing between the implant,
   the surgeon and the host tissue. Thus also the surgical technique will
   benefit from engineering support. Biomedical engineering is a key player
   to achieve this. A good geometric fit between implant and host tissue
   will ensure optimal initial stability. Patient-specific implants can
   ensure this stability, incorporating solid and porous structures where
   needed. Pre-operative computer assisted planning allows to optimize the
   surgical intervention, incorporating patient-specific biomechanical
   models to predict the functional outcome of the surgical intervention.
   And finally, in order to achieve that the pre-operative plan is
   accurately transferred into the surgical practice, computer assisted
   surgery enabled by e.g. navigation, robotics of patient-specific
   surgical instrumentation (guides and implants) can come into play. Key
   to all state of the art developments in computer assisted surgery is the
   engineering on anatomy, enabled by multifunctional softwares and 3D
   printing technologies. Biomechanical modeling allows for
   patient-specific outcome prediction after surgical interventions and
   should become a routine practice in patient treatment. Patient specific
   surgical instrumentation is able to assist in realising the plan with
   sub-millimeter precision. Finally, quantification of the uncertainties
   that are inherent to biomechanical modeling is an essential contribution
   to reliable patient-specific outcome prediction.
   Objectives: Hemodialysis (HD) is a lifesaving therapy in patients with
   end stage renal disease. Little is known about why life expectancy for
   these patients is reduced in Europe and USA as compared to Japan. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of the interdialytic
   weight gain (fluid retention in relation to estimated body weight in \%,
   IDWG) in relation to the dialysis length (hours). Methods: 20
   hemodialysis patients performed besides their regular dialyses 1
   hemodialysis/week within the frame of the study during a 3 week period.
   The baseline values and the change during HD of NT-pro-BNP (ProBNP) and
   Troponin T (TnT) at 180 minutes and pentraxin 3 (PTX) at 30 and 180min
   were compared with the change in IDWG divided by the hours the patient
   performed the HD as a marker of speed of ultrafiltration. The PROOF
   formula used was: {[}100 x Weight gain between dialysis
   (kg)]/{[}estimated body dry weight (kg) x time of HD session (hours)].
   Spearmans correlation analysis was used to adjust for eventual outliers.
   Results: There was a correlation between extent of removal of the
   IDWG/hours of HD: 1) the baseline values of ProBNP (rho=0.54, p<0.001),
   TnT (rho=0.37, p=0.004), PTX (rho=0.26, p=0.043) and 2) the change
   during HD at 30 min of PTX (rho=0.27, p=0.038) and at 180 minutes of
   ProBNP (rho=0.68, p<0.001) and TnT (rho=0.40, p=0.002). 3) a PROOF
   breakpoint < 0.63 caused less release of ProBNP (p<0.001). Discussion:
   The increase in weight between dialyses should be related to the body
   weight. A larger IDWG gives worse conditions. An increased speed of
   fluid in relation to body weight removal causes a higher release of
   cardiac markers indicating a strain and damage to the heart by each HD
   in contrast to what would be expected. Patients should be advised to
   limit fluid intake in relation to their body weight and adjust the HD
   length.
   Objectives: Fish roe is a highly nutritional product with diverse
   beneficial effects for the human health. This work used sardine (Sardina
   pilchardus) roe to produce novel delivery systems presenting antioxidant
   and anti-inflammatory properties. Methods: Methyl-tert-butyl ether
   extraction method was used to obtain lipid- and water-soluble compound
   rich phases. The fatty acids profile was analyzed by GC/MS. The
   identification of the hydrophilic compounds was performed by LC-HRMS.
   Lipids were used to produce large unilamellar liposomes (LUVs). The
   hydration of the lipid film was performed with PBS or sardine
   roe-derived aqueous phase. LUVs were characterized by their size,
   surface potential and morphology. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was
   evaluated using L929 cells. Their antioxidant activity was evaluated
   against different radicals, and their anti-inflammatory activity was
   assessed in the presence of LPS-stimulated macrophages. Results: GC/MS
   analyses demonstrated the presence of several fatty acids, such as omega
   3 fatty acids. LC-HRMS analyses revealed the presence of numerous
   bioactive compounds (e.g. essential amino acids and gadusol). LUVs
   prepared with the aqueous phase presented a higher heterogeneity in
   terms of size than when they were prepared with buffer. Both LUVs
   formulations have a negative surface charge and a spherical shape. The
   extracts presented antioxidant activity against peroxyl, hydroxyl and
   nitric oxide radicals. Biological assays indicated that the extracts are
   cytocompatible for the lowest tested concentrations and that they can
   inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which reveals their
   anti-inflammatory effect. Discussion: Our sardine roe-derived delivery
   systems and compounds have both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
   activities and thus they may be considered as a valid alternative for
   the treatment of inflammatory conditions.
   Objectives: Engineered skeletal muscle tissues in three-dimensional (3D)
   cell culture platforms that resemble the muscles complex native
   structure and organization can be used as in vitro models to study
   muscle physiology and metabolism. This project allows us to develop a
   new platform to model muscle diseases (such as myotonic dystrophy 1) in
   vitro in order to study its response to candidate therapeutics and to
   better understand disease mechanisms of pathogenesis. To this end, we
   monitor the secretion of disease-associated biomarker proteins and
   metabolites. Methods: Here, we present 3D skeletal muscle constructs,
   fabricated by encapsulating C2C12 cells and patient-derived
   transdifferentiated skin fibroblasts in a photocrosslinkable Gelatin
   Methacrylate and Carbolymethylcellulose Methacrylate (GelMA:CMCMA)
   hydrogel and cryogel scaffold. These scaffolds present a microgrooved
   topography that promotes cell alignment and differentiation. Electrical
   stimulation (ES) was then applied to the engineered tissues during cell
   culture to induce spontaneous contraction and maturation of the
   sarcomeres. Cell alignment differentiation, and the effect of ES were
   assessed by calculating the orientation angle and fusion index of
   immunostained myotubes expressing Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC). Results: We
   have obtained a new platform to study the evolution of congenital muscle
   diseases, specifically myotonic dystrophy 1 and evaluate the functional
   tissues by metabolic and gene expression analysis. Monitor the secretion
   of biomarkers proteins, metabolites, and the glycolysis pathway of
   muscle tissues for different drug candidates. Discussion: This platform
   has been tested with different drugs assays and represent a step toward
   the goal of producing in vitro drug testing systems for medical and
   pharmaceutical industry applications. Finally, such ``muscle
   tissue-on-a-chip{''} devices can be fabricated using patient's own cells
   as a major step toward personalized medicine.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is the creation and research of
   properties of tissue-engineering structures by the method of laser
   structuring a nanocarbon framework in bioorganic matrices. Methods: For
   the formation of the framework fibers from single-walled carbon
   nanotubes were used. Aqueous dispersions of nanocarbon fibers and
   proteins of albumin, collagen and amino sugar of chitosan were used as
   the initial medium for printing tissue-engineering structures. Printing
   of structures was carried out using the laser device generating pulsed
   laser radiation. The radiation wavelength was 1064 nm (100 ns pulse
   duration, 100 kHz frequency). Laser radiation using the scanner system
   of the device was moved on the dispersion layer. A computer model
   regulated the trajectory of the movement of radiation. Results: We have
   demonstrated the effect of welding nanocarbon fibers into a framework
   under the action of laser irradiation. The functionalization of
   nanocarbon fibers by protein and amino sugar molecules were proven. It
   was found the diameter of nanocarbon fibers was increased by several
   tens of nanometers due to their wrapping with a bio-organic matrix.
   Tissue-engineering structures had a meshy frame. The mesh size was
   100x100 mu m. The electrical conductivity of the structures increased
   several times and amounted to 1 S/m with laser irradiation. The hardness
   of tissue-engineering structures was 150-370 MPa. The cytological
   compatibility of tissue-engineering structures with fibroblast cells and
   endothelial cells was tested. The density of proliferating cells on
   tissue-engineering structures was 33\% more compared to the control
   type. In vivo investigations indicated the rate of biodegradation of
   tissue-engineering structures when implanted in laboratory animals for
   60-90 days. Discussion: The investigated structures are promising for
   use in medical practice. Such structures can act as cardiac
   tissue-engineering implants since they have physicomechanical and
   biological properties similar to the parameters of cardiac tissue.
   Objectives: A major part of developing rotary blood pumps requires the
   optimization of hemolytic properties of the entire pump. The aim of this
   project was to compare blood flow simulation in the first and second
   generations of the ventricular assist device Sputnik and to evaluate its
   effect. Methods: Studies of the flow field were conducted with
   commercial CFD software ANSYS FLUENT 16.0, which uses a finite-volume
   approach. Scalar shear stresses were calculated for both pumps. The
   pumps were compared in terms of volumes subjected to certain viscous
   shear stress thresholds, below which no trauma was assumed (von
   Willebrand factor cleavage: 9 Pa, platelet activation: 50 Pa, and
   hemolysis: 150 Pa), associated residence times and recirculation zones.
   Results: Volume fractions of shear stress above 9 Pa, 50 Pa, 150 Pa were
   received: Sputnik-1 had 7.69 ml, 2,58ml, 0.74 ml, Sputnik-2 - 3.41 ml,
   1.07 ml, 0.22 ml. The sum of the cell residence times at these shear
   stresses is 0.5095 s for the Sputnik-1 and 0.2019 s for the Sputnik-2.
   The volumes of recirculation zones were obtained, the value is 4.36 ml
   for the Sputnik-1 and 1.72 ml for the Sputnik-2. Discussion: The second
   generation of the VAD Sputnik have better flow characteristics than
   first. In the operating point, the volume fraction of the shear stresses
   is less, the residence time is less and the volume of recirculation
   zones is less.
   Objectives: End-stage renal disease is increasing dramatically in the
   western world and represents a major challenge for health care. Due to
   organ shortage transplantation can help only a few patients who
   otherwise require lifelong hemodialysis. Access for hemodialysis is an
   essential point and carries a high morbidity mainly due to occlusion of
   arterio-venous fistulas (AVF) and/or grafts (AVG). Therefore,
   alternative graft material has to be considered such as tissue
   engineered vascular grafts for access in hemodialysis. Methods: Besides
   patient characteristics and technical issues of surgical procedures the
   choice of the vascular graft is essential. Despite optimization over the
   last years, the clinical results are still sub-optimal due to early
   thrombosis and late intimal hyperplasia of the non-degradable synthetic
   vascular grafts such as Expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), or,
   polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron). Results: New material developments
   and tissue engineering techniques have shown good pre-clinical and
   initial clinical results for AVG implantation in hemodialysis patients.
   These range from acellular and cell-based, stable or bio-degradable,
   synthetic scaffolds to biological (mandril-induced) or decellularized
   grafts as well as self-assembly technologies. Discussion: This symposium
   will review the clinical need and especially address new developments of
   vascular grafts based on tissue engineering.
   Modern heart failure therapy makes use of left ventricular assist
   devices for severe cases as well as other active implants. While these
   devices have come far from their beginnings with improved
   hemocompatibility, smaller size and less invasive implantation
   techniques, their advancement takes close cooperation of engineers and
   clinicians to face the challenges of further advancements. It is vital
   to ensure interdisciplinary communication and exchange to define the
   future of Mechanical Circulatory Support. On the engineering side,
   greater biocompatibility, patient-specificity and options for smart
   devices and telemedicine offer great potential. These developments go
   hand in hand with improved surgical technique and clinical expertise.
   This cooperation will allow us to work towards reduced mortality, less
   adverse clinical events and ultimately improved quality of life for the
   cardiac assist device patient of the future.
   Objectives: To elucidate the role of the solvent and pH in the
   conformational changes of human serum albumin (HSA) and its binding to
   fatty acids. Albumin is a key biomolecule, found in most fluids of the
   body. HSA functions as depot and carrier for many compounds like fatty
   acids and affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Importantly, HSA acts
   as a toxic waste handler, displays pseudo enzymatic properties and it is
   a valuable biomarker in many diseases. Structurally, HSA is a very
   soluble, extremely robust and usually monomeric protein, which features
   three alpha-helical homologous domains that fold into a characteristic
   heart shape. Despite its importance, the reversible pH-dependent
   conformational transitions of HSA in solution are not yet fully
   understood. Methods: To compute the stability differences between the
   different conformers of HSA, we combine molecular dynamics simulations
   (MD) with free energy calculations. We determine the conformational
   free-energy change between conformers of HSA obtained upon introducing
   perturbations in the surroundings (pH, solvent mixtures) and its
   physiologically native state. Extended constant-pH MDs followed by
   Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulations allow us modelling
   these systems at different pH values. We perform free energy
   perturbation calculations to characterize the binding sites of fatty
   acids to HSA under different conditions. Results and Discussion: We
   elucidate, at the molecular level, the effects of the solvent and pH on
   the conformational transitions and functionality of HSA. Our work allows
   establishing ways to modulate such transitions by tuning key
   biomolecular interactions, with implications for biomedical research.
   Objectives: The metal ions can affect differentiation of stem cells,
   which makes them interesting for applications in tissue engineering and
   regenerative in medicine. The layer-by-layer (LbL) technique is based on
   the alternating adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to
   form polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM). Multilayer systems combined with
   metal ions of different concentration might be promising for making
   coatings on implants and scaffolds to regenerate tissues like bone,
   cartilage, and others. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
   influence of the concentration of metal ions on the physical properties
   of Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM), and evaluate the effect of metal
   ions on stem cell adhesion. Methods: Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM)
   prepared by layer-by-layer technique made of polysaccharides hyaluronan
   (HA) as polyanion and chitosan (Chi) as polycation were additionally
   cross-linked by metal ions (Cu2+, Co2+, Ca2+ and Fe3+). to modulate
   physical properties and bioactivity of multilayers to control adhesion
   and function of mesenchymal murine C3H10T1/2 embryonic fibroblasts.
   Characterization of multilayer formation and surface properties was
   performed by different analytical methods. Results: Changes of wetting,
   thickness and mechanical properties of multilayers depending on
   concentration and type of metal ion. Most interesting, however, was the
   finding that metal ions like Fe3+ promoted adhesion and spreading of
   C3H10T1/2 cell greatly on the less adhesive HA/Chi multilayer system
   Discussion: Multilayer systems combined with metal ions can be used to
   regenerate tissues like bone, cartilage and others
   Objectives: The aim of the study is to analyse and modify the gas
   transfer properties of a novel PMP fiber blood gas exchanger with a
   cylindrical shaped blood flow channel by improving the sweep gas flow
   profile through the fiber bundle while considering the fiber length in
   blood contact. Methods: A test set-up has been developed to visualize
   the gas flow through the fiber bundle by means of steam. In an in-vitro
   setting with porcine blood the gas transfer rate has been measured
   subsequently. The cylindrical blood flow geometry and the fact that the
   fibers are stacked with an offset of 90 degrees onto each other results
   in fibers with various effective lengths. For the study, various
   prototypes of gas inlets with different inlet geometries have been
   designed, manufactured and evaluated regarding their gas transfer rates.
   Results: The different designs resulted in the aimed flow profiles
   during the flow visualization. Selected prototypes have been tested with
   blood and the gas transfer rates have been determined. However, the
   modified designs with improved gas flow properties do not significantly
   impact the gas transfer rates measured with blood. Discussion: Two
   possible explanations can be derived from the results which may be
   tested in the course of further studies. Firstly, it is possible that
   the current gas inlet is already sufficiently adapted to the cylindrical
   blood flow geometry and fibers of different effective length. Secondly,
   it could be considered that side parameters such as the diffusive
   transfer of water vapour from the blood side to the gas side have a
   superseding influence on the gas flow profile. In conclusion, the gas
   transfer rates cannot be significantly increased by manipulating the gas
   flow profile through the fiber bundle. Nevertheless, the blood gas
   exchanger achieves already comparable transfer rates to products on the
   market but has reduced PMP membrane surface.
   Objectives: Throughout the history of medical devices, highly invasive
   systems underwent a series of generations prior a successful
   establishment as a widely accepted therapy. The only available THA today
   (SynCardia TAH) is successfully saving lives but comes with a
   significant restriction of the quality of life (QoL) and a
   stigmatization of the patients. According to surgeons this is an
   important factor contributing to the low number of implantations today.
   Methods: Next generation devices using an implanted drive promise a new
   level of QoL and are currently developed by several institutions
   worldwide. Reasons for the long time to market of the next TAH
   generation (>15 years) might be found in the enormous challenges of
   technological aspects together with a difficult marked situation from an
   investors point of view. However, a higher QoL and an increasing trust
   in the reliability of the next TAH generations will inherently lead to a
   higher number of implantations, and further the acceptance of these
   devices towards an established therapy option. Results: The approach of
   the ReinHeart TAH is to adopt the well-proven hydraulic features of the
   SynCardia TAH while improving its current limitations. The ReinHeart TAH
   features a passive filling during diastole, a principal that is also
   successfully applied by the SynCardia TAH. The simple and robust linear
   driving mechanism allows for a compact design, achieving fit in the vast
   majority of patients. Beyond that, the drive principle makes additional
   sensors unnecessary. The compact, smart and usability-driven design of
   the external components will lead to a broad acceptance by the patients.
   Discussion: The unique features of the ReinHeart TAH elevate TAH-therapy
   to the next evolutionary step with regards to robust long-term
   application, size, ease of use and quality of life.
   Objectives: Circulating endothelial cells can be used to diagnose
   cardiovascular diseases. However, their concentration in the blood is
   very low (<100 per ml). A large volume of blood is needed, which should
   not be drawn from the patient. Instead a probe is inserted into the
   bloodstream of the patient to isolate as many cells as possible. The
   geometry of the cell probe is one of the key factors affecting cell
   deposition because its shape influences the flow conditions along the
   cell probe. The aim of this combined in vitro and in silico study is to
   find out the optimal flow conditions for cell deposition aiming to
   develop in future novel optimal cell probe shape. Methods: In vitro
   experiments in a closed loop with endothelial cells from HUVEC cell line
   were carried out and the cell deposition as a function of the probe
   shape (4 probe types) and five different flow rates were investigated.
   The knowledge of the flow conditions at the cell probe was obtained by
   flow simulations by using CFD software STAR CCM+. By combining the
   experimental and simulation data with an iterative procedure, wall shear
   stresses, which seems to promote cell deposition, can be identified.
   Results: It could be shown that the geometry of the cell probe has a
   much greater influence on cell deposition than the flow rates in the
   blood vessel. Wall shear stress around 0.4 Pa seems to be responsible
   for the optimal deposition of endothelial cells. However, this flow
   condition does not correlate with all flow rate experiments. Discussion:
   The results of the combined in vitro - in silico study on deposition of
   endothelial cells on the existing cell probe design are promising.
   However, the used in vitro set up does not allow to extract maximal
   information from each test and should be redesigned.
   Objectives: The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) consists of the
   pump, driveline and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to
   failure. According to the recent research only 13\% of failures were due
   to the pump itself, while over 60\% were due to batteries, controllers
   and peripheral cables. Taking into account usability factors we present
   a novel control unit for the rotary blood pumps aimed to decrease LVAD
   malfunction. Methods: The pump motor windings are leaded out by doubled
   wires (six total) via driveline to the extracorporeal splitter where the
   driveline is divided by two ways. Each way consists of three pump motor
   phase signals and three current sense signals from the other way. The
   two identical control units with integrated rechargeable batteries are
   connected to each way of the splitter simultaneously. This symmetrical
   peripherals architecture allows each control unit to drive the pump (in
   the active mode) or sense the parameters from the parallel way (in the
   passive mode). The control is based on the field oriented control method
   that allows the passive unit to continuously monitor the direction and
   magnitude of the magnetic field vector in the pump, which is created by
   the active unit and, upon loss of control, immediately begins to
   generate control signals with the necessary amplitude and phase. In case
   of mismatch of the parameters in any control units, alarms are to occur.
   Results: Novel Sputnik LVAD was developed according to the described
   philosophy. This LVAD system has a backup feature which covers almost
   all peripherals including driveline, control system and battery. In case
   of the single fault condition in the peripherals the system continues to
   drive the pump with pause in the control less than 4 ms. Discussion:
   Developed peripherals integrated in the LVAD allow reducing the risk of
   the device malfunction and improving usability.
   Objectives: Polysaccharides belong to the most abundant biomaterials on
   earth. They form structural elements of plant and animal tissues, but
   many of them have also important regulatory functions towards cells,
   tissues and organs. Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and other carboxylated and
   sulfated polysaccharides possess a bioactivity that is due to their high
   affinity to a plethora of proteins forming insoluble and soluble
   components of cell environments, but also direct interaction with cell
   receptors. Methods: Making surface coatings for implants from natural or
   semisynthetic GAG that guide cell behavior requires different strategies
   of covalent or physical attachment. Simple covalent binding mechanisms
   can be based on oxidation of pendant hydroxyl groups of monosaccharide
   subunits or introduction of reactive side groups like thiols that permit
   direct coupling to surfaces. Results: Physical can exploit the inherent
   charge of these molecules that permits formation of multilayers kept
   together by ion pairing, but also intrinsic cross-linking of activated
   GAG. Both mechanism can be also used to form 3D structures as
   biocompatible in situ gelling hydrogels that permit embedding of growth
   factors and cells. Discussion: These 2D and 3D systems are instructive
   controlling cell spreading, growth and differentiation, which will be
   shown with examples on chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of
   mesenchymal stem and other cells.
   Objectives: A successful creation and adequate maturation of
   arteriovenous fistula (AVF) provides efficient treatment and long term
   patient survival. The aim of the study was to determine the predictors
   for primary failure of AVF, such as gender, age, AVF site of creation,
   and primary renal disease, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)
   stage 4/5. Methods: The medical records of 178 created arteriovenous
   fistulae in patients with CKD stage 4/5, in a single center for the year
   2018, were retrospectively studied. Primary failure of AVF was defined
   as thrombosis or inability for cannulation of the fistula within 3
   months of creation. Early thrombosis of AVF was defined as an immediate
   failure due to thrombosis of the fistula within 24 hours of creation.
   Adequate maturation of AVF was defined as successful cannulation of AVF
   for efficient HD. Results: The mean age of the patients was 59.75 +/-
   14.65 years, and 65.16\% (116/178) were men. Adequate maturation of
   fistulae was achieved in 83.71\% (149/178). Primary failure of AVF
   occurred in 16.29\% (29/178) of the created fistulae, while 10.11\%
   (18/178) had early thrombosis. Distal AVF (radio-cephalic) was the
   dominant site with 38.76\% (69/178) of the created fistulae, followed by
   middle-arm AVF (radio-cephalic) site in 32.02\% (57/178) and proximal
   AVF (brachio-basilic) site in 29.22\% (52/178) of the created fistulae.
   The distal fistulae were significantly more frequently created in male
   patients (51 vs 18; p=0,015). The female patients were significantly
   older than the male patients (63.27 vs 57.86 years; p=0,018). The
   patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) were significantly older than the
   non-DM patients (63.65 vs 58.05 years; p=0,018). Discussion: Hospital
   strategy for creation of a permanent vascular access for hemodialysis is
   an ``Arteriovenous fistula first{''}. The female gender was more
   frequently associated with primary failure of AVF, while age, AVF
   creation site, and primary renal disease were not.
   Objectives: Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its co-polymer with
   trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) demonstrating biocompatibility and
   piezoelectric property are among the most promising biomaterials for
   nerve regeneration. Their blends with polydiphenylene phthalide (PDP)
   can improve nerve tissue regeneration due to combined electrical
   switching effect of PDP. Methods: Electrospinning and film casting were
   used to produce porous electrospun fibre mats and thin films,
   respectively. SEM, DSC, RAMAN and FTIR spectroscopy, as well as
   piezoelectric measurements were performed to analyse morphology and
   physical-chemical properties of initial and final materials. A special
   measuring cell was designed to conduct dielectric spectroscopy
   measurements on samples with both deposited and pressed contacts.
   Results: Electrospun PVDF-TrFE and PVDF-TrFE+PDP fibre mats and casted
   PVDF-TrFE, PVDF, PVDF-TrFE+PDP film samples were produced. The range of
   fibre diameter of 0.5-1.2 mu m was obtained from SEM images. RAMAN
   (500-3500 cm(-1)) and FTIR (600-2000 cm(-1)) spectra were obtained for
   initial and final materials. The dependence of the samples capacity on
   the uniaxial pressure was measured. The frequency dependence of the
   capacitance and tangent of the dielectric loss angle tg(delta) at a
   constant uniaxial pressure has also been analysed. Discussion: RAMAN
   spectrum of PDP+PVDF-TrFE fibre mats contains peaks from PDP and
   PVDF-TrFE, indicating that electrospinning method is suitable to produce
   PDP-containing PVDF-TrFE materials. Results of dielectric measurements
   showed that the presence of TrFE in co-polymer significantly reduces the
   value of the samples' capacitance. The capacitance of fibrous samples is
   much lower than that of films due to high porosity of fibre mats
   (>90\%). TrFE-containing samples demonstrate high dielectric losses at
   low frequencies. The combined analysis of dielectric and piezoelectric
   properties is ongoing.
   Objectives: The objective of this study is the development of a magnetic
   levitation system of a new type of blood pump. A fully magnetically
   levitated plate is oscillating in a trapezoidal shaped pump housing to
   create a relatively blood gentle flow. The oscillating movement of the
   plate is realized with a combination of a driven harmonic oscillator and
   a 1-degree-of-freedom magnetic levitation system. Methods: Multiple
   design concepts utilizing different electromagnetic principles were 3D
   modelled with Solid Works and imported into Ansys Mawell 3D to execute
   electromagnetic FEM simulations. Based on the results, the most suitable
   concept was selected by means of electromagnetic performance, stability,
   use of space and general feasibility. A PID-controller was implemented
   using Matlab/Simulink. The feasibility and stability of the concept was
   tested on a full-scale prototype. Results: The prototype demonstrates
   the feasibility and stability of the concept. The stabilization of the
   plate can be realized with an electric current that is about 7 times
   lower than bearable for the electromagnetic coils of the first
   prototype, allowing further miniaturization of future prototypes.
   Discussion: Though the general feasibility of the concept could be
   demonstrated, tests of the pumping performances are still pending to
   evaluate the suitability of the pump as an implantable blood pump.
   Objectives: Long term survival rate after the resection for the
   esophageal carcinoma has not been satisfactory. One of the most
   important topics in the area of the esophageal cancer is the
   reconstruction of the esophageal tract. If the artificial esophagus can
   be constructed, this technology will be beneficial for patients with
   esophageal cancer in the advanced stage. Methods: In the previous
   reports, artificial esophagus with shape memory (SMA) alloy actuator had
   been reported. However, total occlusion of the esophageal tract had been
   difficult. In this study, Origami engineering technology had been used
   for the peristaltic motion. Triangle shape of the Origami structure had
   been designed in this study for the total occlusion of the esophageal
   tracts to prevent the gastroesophageal reflux. The corner of the
   triangle had been pulled by SMA actuators following the diagonal lines
   for the folding power. Results: In the design concept of this artificial
   esophagus, the artificial esophageal tracts will be sutured to the
   human's esophagus. In this stage, the artificial esophageal tracts were
   consisted by the artificial vessel's material, and in the next stage
   regenerative esophagus will be the candidates. Esophageal tracts will be
   covered with triangle shape tracts with SMA actuator to embody the
   peristalsis. In the results in this study, total occlusion of the
   artificial esophageal tracts had been embodied by the use of the Origami
   structure. Through the arrangement of the triangle shape origami
   structures, co-driving will be embodied for the peristalsis function.
   Discussion: Until now, there had been no success in achieving
   peristalsis motion of the artificial esophagus. For the application of
   the human esophageal tracts, more study is necessary. This study was the
   first step for the application of the new artificial esophagus in the
   world for the achievement of the totally occluded peristalsis.
   Objectives: The transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell
   (hiPSC)-derived grafts represents an alternative treatment option for
   post-myocardial infarction patients. So far, myocardial tissue
   engineering mainly focused on the generation of ventricular-like tissues
   providing sufficient contractile function. Atrial- and pacemaker-like
   cardiomyocytes (CMs) are hypothesized to have a negative effect on
   tissue function, as they could lead to a lower force development and to
   arrhythmias after transplantation, respectively. Therefore, we aim to
   characterize subtype composition in the differentiated CM cultures, as
   well as in generated tissues thereof and analyze tissue functionality.
   Methods: The hiPSC-CMs are then mixed with human fibroblasts and a
   matrix to generate bioartifical cardiac tissues (BCTs) using our
   established bioreactor technology. In order to assess the ratio of
   individual iPSC-derived CM subtypes, flow cytometry and
   immunofluorescence (IF) stainings with antibodies targeting
   subtype-specific markers (MLC2v, COUPTF-2, and MLC2a) were performed.
   Results: First results revealed a high percentage (80-90\%) of MLC2v
   positive cells in differentiated CM populations. The remaining cells
   stained positive for atrial markers (COUPTF-2, MLC2a). Functional
   measurements mainly focused on BCT contractility and showed forces
   similar to the native myocardium (6.5 mN/mm2). In addition, we observed
   that a higher proportion of ventricular-like CMs leads to higher
   contractile BCT function. Discussion: Taken together, these molecular
   and functional results reveal that our differentiation protocol led to
   the formation of mainly ventricular-like CMs and that BCTs generated
   thereof show typical characteristics of myocardial tissues. For future
   ventricular-like tissue replacement therapy, we aim to perform a risk
   assessment for ``contaminating{''} cardiac cell types with respect to
   both BCT function and arrhythmias.
   Objectives: Standardized hemolysis tests according to ASTM F1841-97
   (2017) are the current gold standard for hemolysis evaluation. As part
   of the standard flow loop, a screw clamp is used to regulate the flow
   resistance in the circulations. Especially with extracorporeal pumps
   used for lung support, cardiopulmonary bypass application, or
   C0(2)-Removal, resistance has to maintain a pressure gradient of more
   than 500 mmHg. As a consequence, the screw clamp itself turns into a
   critical hemolysis hotspot, possibly overlying and biasing the hemolysis
   caused by the tested pump. Therefore, we present an alternative
   resistance causing only low hemolysis and at the same time maintaining
   ASTM testing specifications. Methods: We developed one novel resistance
   and evaluated the hemolysis potential of the novel and one alternative
   in flow loops. The flow loops were set up according to the ASTM standard
   with three identical pumps (Deltastream (R) DP3, Medos AG), two with the
   novel and alternative resistances each and one with the state-of-the art
   resistance, the screw clamp. The loops were set to high pressure
   conditions present in cardiopulmonary bypass applications, ECMO or
   C0(2)-Removal. The loops operated for 6 hours with porcine blood (n =
   6). Blood samples were drawn hourly and free plasma hemoglobin was
   evaluated by means of photometric measurement. Results: A new resistance
   for ASTM pump evaluation at high pressure regimes with little impact on
   hemolysis was developed. The resistance is easy to integrate into the
   recirculation loop and can be adjusted continuously. In-vitro blood
   trials revealed lower hemolysis for the new resistance compared to the
   current gold standard. Discussion: Extracorporeal continuous flow blood
   pumps with transfemoral cannulation work against high pressure at low
   flow. Up to now, hemolysis evaluation of the pumps is biased by
   hemolysis caused by the flow loop resistance. Our newly designed
   resistance causes less hemolysis, thus allowing for more meaningful and
   reliable hemolysis test results.
   Objectives: To characterize the biological background of prothrombotic
   platelet function in the setting of durable Mechanical Circulatory
   Support (MCS) with Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) and to
   evaluate influence of different antithrombotic regimens dictated by
   specific clinical needs. Methods: Platelet thrombin generation was
   quantified in 75 LVAD patients implanted with the HeartMate II (n=10,
   13\%), HeartMate 3 (n=27, 36\%), or HeartWare HVAD (n=38, 51\%) using
   the Platelet Activity State (PAS) Assay and the Thrombin Generation Test
   (TGT). Data was compared in patients managed with i) oral
   anticoagulation plus aspirin (n=46, 61\%) or ii) anticoagulation alone
   (n=29, 39\%) due to significant bleeding risk. Coagulation parameters
   (platelet count, International Normalized Ratio {[}INR], activated
   Partial Thromboplastin Time {[}aPTT], Fibrinogen and D-Dimers levels)
   and hemolysis index (lactate dehydrogenase levels, LDH) were also
   recorded to comprehensively characterize hemostatic profiles and actual
   prothrombotic risk in the two groups. Results: The PAS assay revealed
   low-intensity increase in platelet prothrombinase activity in patients
   without aspirin (1.13-fold higher; p=0.04). Similarly, the TGT revealed
   moderate higher platelet reactivity in patients not on aspirin,
   consistent with reduction of lag time (0.87-fold lower; p<0.001),
   increase in peak of thrombin generation (1.5-fold higher; p=0.002) and
   thrombin generation rate (2-fold higher; p=0.01), but comparable
   endogenous thrombin potential (p>0.05). Coagulation parameters and LDH
   levels were not different in these two groups (p>0.05). Discussion: In
   patients with a durable MCS, aspirin minimally modulates the biochemical
   pathway of platelet thrombin generation. Re-evaluation of antithrombotic
   management criteria in selected patients stratified according to
   bleeding risk might significantly reduce LVAD hemcompatibility-related
   adverse events.
   Objectives: To determine the value of post-reperfusion kidney biopsyin
   predicting renal function and the incidence rate of DGF in deceased
   donor renal transplant recipients within 1 year after the surgery.
   Methods: We retrospectively included 461 patients who accepted the
   donation after the death of citizen at our center. According to the
   Remuzzi criteria, we compared the pathological biopsy and graft outcome
   between right and left donor kidneys from the same donor.Remuzzi score 
   pound 3 was divided into low group, 4-6 middle group, > 6 high group.
   The incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR) and
   renal function within 1 year after surgery was observed. A multivariate
   analysis was conducted on the risk factors of kidney function and DGF
   incidence. Results: Of the 461 recipients,458 recipients have good graft
   function and 3 grafts failed. The reperfusion kidney biopsy, the
   incidence of graft DGF and renal function at each time point after
   transplantation between the left and right kidneys from the same donor
   were same (p>0.05). 88.1\% was in low group, 10.4\% in middle group, and
   1.5\% in high group. The incidence of DGF and the eGFR in different time
   points after transplantation were different (p<0.05). Multivariate
   analysis revealed that last creatinine before acquisition and Remuzzi
   score were independent predictors of DGF after transplantation (p<0.05).
   Vascular scores were independent risk factors affecting renal function
   at 1 year after transplantation(p<0.05) Discussion: The reperfusion
   renal allograft biopsy can reflect the donor's baseline data and predict
   early renal function after transplantation. Renal vascular disease may
   be an independent predictor of poor prognosis of the graft.
   The ongoing development of modern manufacturing processes, as well as
   the automation and cross-linking of production facilities opens up new
   freedoms for the individualized manufacturing of medical devices. The
   patient-specific design of these highly loaded devices is associated
   with a high degree of experience on the part of the designer. The
   assessment of the safety and performance of these `` lot size 1
   products{''} cannot be carried out economically by mechanical testing.
   This results in a verification gap in the product life cycle of
   patient-specific medical devices. A verification of the design and thus
   the evaluation of the function and safety of the products can only be
   carried out economically with the help of automated numerical
   simulations. A software to perform virtual strength assessment of custom
   implants was developed. The lecture shows how the verification process
   of patient-individual designs with numerical methods, can contribute to
   the increase of patient safety. In addition, the integration and
   documentation of numerical simulations within the product life cycle
   will be presented using industrial examples.
   Objectives: One of the most pressing issues of regenerative medicine is
   the fabrication of constructs with defined parameters in order to create
   conditions for proper cell adhesion and proliferation that will be close
   to native tissue conditions. An application utilizing the
   electrospinning method may potentially solve this problem. The main goal
   of this study was to fabricate electrospun scaffolds based on silk
   fibroin and to characterize their properties. Methods: Silk fibroin
   scaffolds were obtained by electrospinning method. There were two types
   of scaffolds: 1) silk fibroin scaffolds, 2) silk fibroin scaffolds with
   addition of 30 per cent of gelatin by mass. Scaffold structure was
   investigated by scanning electron microscopy and scanning probe
   nanotomography. Cell adhesion and proliferation were investigated in
   mice fibroblasts 3T3 model. The regenerative potential of scaffolds was
   estimated in a model of Wistar rat full-thickness skin wound
   regeneration. Results: The electrospun scaffolds have fibrous porous
   structure with an average fiber thickness 300-600 nm. Both types of
   scaffolds are biocompatible in vitro. Presence of gelatin in scaffold
   composition improves cell proliferation. Scaffolds promote skin wound
   regeneration and restore native skin structure. Histological analysis
   did not evolve inflammatory process. Discussion: Electrospinning is a
   promising method to obtain fibrous biomimetic constructs with defined
   properties. The biocompatibility of produced constructs was shown in
   vitro and in vivo. Both types of scaffolds have a significant
   regenerative potential and are prospects for different fields of
   regenerative medicine.
   Objectives: Biodegradable PCL-based electrospun scaffolds are often used
   in TE. However, such scaffolds lack biocompatibility, wettability and
   chemical accessibility for tendon replacement applications. Here, we
   propose a new method to overcome those shortcomings by using
   PCL:Chitosan-graft-PCL (PCL:CS-g-PCL) blends instead of post-process
   coatings. Methods: Blended solutions of PCL (175 mg/ml in 2,2,2-TFE) and
   CS-g-PCL (1200 mg/ml in chloroform) were electrospun into scaffolds with
   CS-g-PCL from 0 to 90 wt\% (10 ratios). SEM based measurements were
   carried out to investigate fiber diameter and morphology. Chitosan amino
   groups within the fibers were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (H-1-NMR) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). DSC
   measurements were conducted to assess thermal properties and
   crystallinity. Subsequently, metabolic activity of human mesenchymal
   stromal cells (hMSC) seeded on the scaffolds, was determined over 7
   days. Results: Blends with CS-g-PCL contents < 90 wt\% led to fiber
   diameter of 1 +/- 0.35 mu m and to 2 +/- 0.38 mu m for 90 wt\%. XPS
   measurements showed an enrichment of chitosan amino groups at the
   surface of the fibers. The enthalpy of fusion increased by up to 40 J/g
   for CS-g-PCL contents from 0 to 90 wt\%, indicating a significant
   increase in crystallinity. hMSCs had maximum metabolic activity on
   samples with CS-g-PCL contents between 10 and 30 wt\%. Discussion:
   Electrospinning of blended PCL:CS-g-PCL solutions resulted in higher
   crystallinity while preserving mechanical properties. Furthermore,
   increased wettability improved biocompatibility and chemical
   accessibility, which ultimately influenced the metabolic activity of the
   hMSCs positively. This promising novel approach will increase the
   biocompatibility of PCL-based scaffolds with simultaneous reduction in
   production complexity.
   Objectives: Biventricular assist device (BVAD) is reported to be used in
   3-5\% of continuous-flow VAD (cf-VAD). Our recent strategy is to
   stabilize INTERMACS profile 1 or unstable profile 2 patients by
   paracorporeal VAD, central ECMO or IABP before proceeding to cf-VAD.
   Patients with RV failure are also aggressively treated by PDE-5
   inhibitors or endothelin receptor antagonist at the outpatient clinic
   after implant. We examined validity of this strategy by analyzing BVAD
   necessity and patient survival. All cf-VAD was used for bridge to
   transplantation. Average waiting time for heart transplantation is
   nearly 3.5 years in our country. Methods: 166 consecutive patients were
   implanted with cf-VAD. DCM was seen in 113, ICM in 14, dHCM in 12,
   post-myocarditis CM in 6, ARVC in 3, RCM in 3 and others in 15. 130
   patients underwent primary cf-LVAD implantation. Pre-implant profiles of
   those patients were 2 in 62, 3 in 62 and 4 in 6. 36 patients were
   converted from another type of mechanical circulatory support (MCS).
   Actuarial survival was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and
   comparisons were made using Log-rank method. Results: No patient
   required RVAD at the time of implantation nor late after implantation.
   Average support duration was 787 days, and 53 patients were on the
   support longer than 3 years. During follow-up 56 patients reached
   transplantation, 9 weaned from VAD due to functional recovery and 80
   on-going support. 1-, 2-, 3-year survival of 166 patients was 92.8\%,
   89.5\% and 85.9\%. There were no statistical differences between
   subgroups, such as sex, pre-implant profile, body size and primary/redo
   sternotomy. Discussion: We successfully implanted cf-LVAD and managed in
   the outpatient clinic without RVAD support in 166 consecutive patients,
   including those who were severely ill in the pre-implant stage. Our
   strategy for stabilizing profile 1 and unstable profile 2 patients by
   other types of MCS and aggressive use of PDE-5 inhibitors or endothelin
   receptor antagonist seemed to be safe and effective.
   Objectives: Recently, composite bionanomaterials containing biological
   materials and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been actively studied. CNTs
   may contain catalytic ferromagnetic nanoparticles and they can affect
   the properties of the composite bionanomaterial. To the study of this
   issue, we paid attention. The object of the study was a composite
   nanomaterial consisting of bovine serum albumin (BSA - matrix) and
   single-walled CNT (SWCNT - filler). Methods: Aqueous dispersion in the
   composition of 20 wt.\% BSA and 0.01 wt.\%. SWCNTs were prepared using
   traditional nanotechnology methods (thorough mixing, ultrasonic
   homogenization, decanting, etc.). The optical density of dispersion was
   measured after a magnetic field gradient ( 1 T/m) was applied to it for
   100 hours. The obtained values were compared with the optical dispersion
   density in the absence of a magnetic field. Recent samples were
   considered control. Results: It was found that under the action of a
   magnetic field, the optical density of the water dispersion of BSA/SWCNT
   in the region of 300 divided by 800 nm decreases by > 10\% relative to
   control samples. Additionally, it was found that under the action of a
   magnetic field, the optical density of the aqueous dispersion of
   BSA/SWCNT decreases by > 10\% relative to control samples. Discussion:
   The decrease in the optical dispersion density of BSA/SWCNT is caused by
   the deposition of nanotubes on the cell surface under the action of a
   magnetic field gradient. It is assumed that the single walled carbon
   nanotubes contain catalytic ferromagnetic nanoparticles. Estimates
   showed that in bionanomaterial at a level with concentrations > 0.0001
   wt.\% CNT nanotubes can be fixed with modern sensors of a weak magnetic
   field with a threshold sensitivity of <= 1 pT. It was concluded that
   changes in implants in the BSA/SWCNT composite bionanomaterials can be
   observed non-invasively with the help of weak magnetic field sensors
   (for example, SQUID or CMFS).
   Objectives: Recent developments in imaging technology have enabled
   cryobiologists to reveal some mechanisms employed by nature to cope with
   freezing stress. The systematic study of these mechanisms may prove
   useful for developing ultimately novel and efficient cryopreservation
   protocols. In this work, we examine the potential advantages of using
   infrared video thermography (IVT) for monitoring latent heat release and
   freeze-thaw events in 3D porous collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffolds used
   as a model system. In this context, we present ongoing results on the
   identification of warm ice-nucleating agents (INA) from Hippophae
   rhamnoides with potential use in cryopreservation of tissue-engineered
   constructs (TECs). Methods: The scaffolds were prepared by freeze-drying
   of mineralized collagen suspensions and characterized by Raman
   microscopy, X-ray microcomputed tomography and differential scanning
   calorimetry. Visualization of freezing/thawing events in scaffolds
   frozen with and without cryoprotective solutions based on leaf
   homogenate from Hippophae rhamnoides was performed using the
   thermography-based platform developed at the University of Thessaly.
   Results: Scaffolds presented 3D porous architecture and characteristic
   RAMAN peaks of collagen type I and hydroxyapatite (HAP). Presence of HAP
   decreased the specific heat capacity of collagen scaffolds. The
   probability of ice nucleation was higher in cryoptotective solutions
   with scaffolds than in solutions without. The ice nucleation temperature
   within scaffolds using INA was determined to be around -1.5 degrees C.
   Discussion: IVT proved to be a very effective approach for visualizing
   latent heat release and freeze-thaw events within scaffolds frozen in
   cell culture plates. INA from Hippophae rhamnoides may potentially be
   used for prevention of supercoiling in cryopreservation. The results
   obtained could serve as a basis for further development of efficient
   cryopreservation protocols for 3D TECs.
   Objectives: In the development process of heart assist devices,
   numerical simulations become more and more essential. The variety of
   applications comprises different types of cannulas or flow geometries of
   ventricular assist devices (VADs). The analysis of the flow field inside
   VADs by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is extremely useful.
   Numerical parameter studies allow the treatment of several device
   related problems in conjunction with a well-balanced cost-benefit ratio.
   Methods: Results obtained from properly performed CFD calculations
   permit the determination of flow induced blood damage of new flow
   designs in VADs and enable the prediction of the risk of harmful
   hemolysis for the patient. The literature provides different models for
   blood cell damages. In application, a proper definition of acceptable
   thresholds is required, in order to optimize blood guiding geometries as
   rotor blades or diffusor shapes in VADs. Another application of CFD can
   be found in the field of flow path optimization of new cannula designs.
   Corresponding results can lead to various design changes and can
   significantly contribute to a comprehensive risk analysis for regulatory
   assessment. Results: Based on the numerical results, geometrical design
   iterations can considerably improve the flow design of blood pumps and
   cannulas. Thoroughly optimized designs exert reduced shear stresses to
   the cells and create less damage to the patient's blood. Furthermore,
   CFD studies can provide valuable information in the process of risk
   analysis during the regulatory assessment of heart assist devices and
   support the interpretation of experimental in-vitro investigations.
   Discussion: Although numerical simulations represent a commonly used
   tool during research and development in the field of heart assist
   devices, the introduction of strict requirements and well-defined
   guidelines would considerably simplify the implementation of numerical
   studies for regulatory approval and enhance the comparability of
   independently gained results.
   Objectives: Current standards in cryopreservation for biomedical
   technology are still based on slow freezing processes inducing
   crystallization within the sample. In preparation for this
   cryopreservation regime, cells and tissues are detached from growth
   surfaces and dissociated into single cell suspensions. Existing
   infrastructures like freezing devices, lab ware, and liquid nitrogen
   tanks for long-term storage, are designed for the handling of suspended
   cells and tissues and for stock keeping purposes, these procedures
   usually are efficient enough. Through the addition of cryoprotective
   agents, the sample can cope with the emerging damaging mechanism
   resulting from ice crystal formation. However, diagnostically and
   therapeutically relevant cell systems, e.g. human induced pluripotent
   stem cells (hiPSCs) or their derivates like neuronal cells, depend on
   cell-cell and cell-surface interactions mediated by cytoskeletal
   proteins. Their structures are disordered, either due to these
   preparatory dissociating steps or due to crystallization, resulting in
   loss of functionality or cell loss in general. Methods: A second
   cryopreservation regime, the vitrification, avoids crystallization
   within the sample and thus avoids the occurring damaging mechanisms
   (e.g. shear forces, osmotic shock). Thereby, the structure of cells and
   tissues is preserved, leading to viable and functional cells even in
   their adherent state (with cell-cell and cell-surface contacts) after
   thawing. However, vitrification requires a skilled handling and so far,
   the infrastructure has not been established to enable routine
   vitrification workflows for large cell numbers. Results and Discussion:
   Our work shows the potential and capacity of vitrification on different
   cell types (e.g. hiPSCs, dopaminergic neurons). We demonstrate that
   vitrification is superior to slow freezing regarding cell loss and
   functionality and holds the possibility to cryopreserve scalable and
   ready-to-use cell products for a broad range of biomedical research.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to characterize the decellularized
   human chorion membrane (dHCM) and to study its suitability as a
   substrate to model biological barriers. Methods: HCMs were submitted to
   a chemical and physical decellularization process. The decellularization
   protocol was optimized by quantifying and analyzing the presence and
   distribution of cell nuclei and dsDNA by DAPI staining, PicoGreen and
   electrophoresis. The dHCM was characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), immunohistochemistry, Dot-Blot, SDS-PAGE, and GAGs and
   Collagen quantification. Moreover, dHCM's mechanical properties were
   assessed and biocompatibility tests (metabolic and proliferation assays)
   with an endothelial human cell line (EA.hy.926) were performed. Results:
   The decellularization process of the HCM was successful, since the
   presence of nuclei was not observed, the amount of dsDNA was around 10
   ng/mg of dry tissue, and the DNA fragments had less than 200 bp. A
   compact membrane that preserved the HCM's reticular layer and basement
   membrane was obtained. SEM images revealed that dHCM is a substrate with
   two different surfaces: one composed by nanofibers and the other (in
   trophoblast layer's side) covered by a thin compact layer (basement
   membrane). In tissue sections it was possible to verify the presence of
   collagen type I and IV, fibronectin and laminin in both dHCM and native
   tissue. Corroborating these results higher molecular weight species were
   preserved in dHCM (SDS-PAGE). Additionally, dHCM's mechanical properties
   were determined: young's modulus of 5.9 MPa and ultimate tensile
   strength of 5.3 MPa. Differences in metabolic activity and cell
   proliferation were observed between both sides of the dHCM. Discussion:
   dHCM retained the main proteins of the extracellular matrix. Cell
   proliferation and viability were higher in the side of dHCM that
   preserved the basement membrane. dHCM's physical and mechanical
   properties make it a suitable substrate to mimic biological barriers.
   Objectives: Cryogels with improved non-fouling and cell adhesive surface
   properties were investigated as potential cell scaffold for BAL purpose.
   Cryogel monolith columns were used by other groups to fill the
   bioreactor chamber. However, device performance was not maintained for
   more than a few hours. Fluid dynamic measurements using a purpose-built
   mu PIV setup with video post-processing were conducted in order to
   extrapolate the effect of flow inside the cryogel matrix to improve cell
   viability and avoid blood cell activation. Starting from PIV results, a
   multi-layered bioreactor composed of spaced cryogel discs was developed
   to maximise blood/hepatocyte mass-exchange. This study aimed to
   investigate whether the multi-layered design results in improved
   performance compared to the column version in terms of hepatocytes
   viability and functionality. Methods: p(HEMA-co-MBA) cryogels were
   synthesised by cryogelation technique. Cryogels were then functionalised
   with alginate and RGD peptide and synthesised by solid phase method.
   Porous structure was analysed with SEM, confocal imaging and mu CT.
   Non-fouling properties were investigated by protein absorption studies.
   Cell viability was assessed by MTT/ATP activity and live/dead imaging.
   Hepatocyte functionality in bioreactors was investigated by
   quantification of albumin and urea production using ELISA and
   colorimetric assay, respectively, over time. Results: Synthesised
   cryogels possessed an open porosity with pore sizes of up to 100 mu m
   and an interconnected network of pores. Alginate helped preventing
   protein absorption from plasma. RGD peptide enhanced hepatocyte
   functionality. Cryogel perfused bioreactors maintained hepatocytes
   viability and functionality for up to 1 week. Discussion: Multi-layered
   bioreactor design showed a significantly higher production of albumin
   and urea compared to the column version, suggesting an improved mass
   exchange between medium and cells. Also cell colonization and
   proliferation through the device were improved.
   Objectives: Placental complex, including placental tissues, foetal
   membranes, and umbilical cord, is one of the most promising sources of a
   range of tissues and cells for clinical and experimental application in
   regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Certain components of
   placental material are already applied in medicine since decades, while
   others undergo intensive research and pre-clinical trials. Since
   placenta is a temporary organ, it provides the unique opportunity to
   obtain large amounts of tissues, including autologous, without the
   adverse effects to the donor. Moreover, great potential of placental
   multipotent stromal cells is recognized in generation of tissue
   engineered multicellular constructs. At the same time, clinical use and
   research proceedings are significantly restricted due to imperfections
   in storage technologies. Application of low-temperature preservation
   methods is especially challenging for 3-D multicellular structures, such
   as organs, tissues, and tissue engineered constructs. Methods: Here we
   aim to analyze the variety of cryoinjuries in a range of placental
   tissues and tissue engineered multicellular placental constructs, as
   well as support the cellular viability after low temperature storage. A
   range of cell and tissue culture as well as tissue engineering methods,
   cryomicroscopic analysis, evaluation of phenotypic and metabolic
   characteristics have been applied in this study. Results: Results have
   shown that the mechanisms of damage caused by cryopreservation
   procedures depend on particular structure of the studied object,
   peculiarities of intercellular bonds, as well as interaction with
   cryoprotective agents. At the same time, developed protocols allowed us
   to efficiently isolate viable cells after thawing of the studied
   tissues. Discussion: Conclusions of this study may lead to progress in
   improvement of biobanking technologies for tissues and tissue engineered
   multicellular constructs.
   Extracorporeal therapies, such as hemodialysis, apheresis or blood
   oxygenation, are only possible when recurrent blood access is feasible.
   Both, artificial grafts, e.g. made of polyethylene-terephthalate (Dacron
   (R)) or a fistula are not ideal models for that purpose and are commonly
   considered to represent the Achilles` Heel of extracorporeal blood
   circuits. A stable, implantable biologic vascular graft would be an
   ideal solution for the benefit of patients and many bioengineers are
   working on this dream to come true. When considering such a vascular
   graft to be used clinically and as a product to be sold in the medical
   device market, a series of problems with regard to approval have to be
   solved and some fundamental questions be answered. Regarding approval,
   current EU regulations refer to either the Medical Device Regulation
   (MDR) from 2017 or to Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products Regulation
   (ATMPs) from 2007. Under the premise ``Better safe than sorry!{''}
   regulations, such as MDR and ATMP, represent a European law. A
   bioengineered vascular graft is taken as a ``combination product{''}, as
   it is commonly made of biological cells and a (possibly) biodegradable
   scaffold material. When implanted, it would represent a high-risk class
   III medical device under the MDR regulation and would require a CE-mark.
   The ATMP regulation, however, says that a combination product has to be
   approved following the ``principal mode of action{''}. For products
   containing viable cells or tissues, a specific approach has been taken
   by the EU. For these products it holds true that ``whatever the role of
   the medical device, the pharmacological, immunological or metabolic
   action of these cells are considered to be the principal mode of
   action{''}. Under these premises, a combination product, such as a
   bioengineered vascular graft, is regulated under the ATMP rules, which
   renders approval rather complex. Consequences refer to the need of Phase
   I-III clinical trials including post-market surveillance
   Neuroengineering is a research area where engineering skills are used to
   solve basic and clinical problems in neuroscience. The aim of the
   presentation is to give an insight into neuroengineering applied in
   neurosurgery. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a method for reducing
   symptoms in movement disorders as Parkinson's disease and essential
   tremor. A thin electrode is surgically implanted with stereotactic
   technique at a well-defined brain structure. Our research focus on
   support systems for improving the surgical implantation procedure, and
   to increase the understanding of the DBS mechanism. A method for
   performing patient-specific simulations of the electric field around a
   DBS lead and map the data to the anatomy has been developed. The goal is
   to create improvement and side-disorder maps for the most common
   symptoms and brain targets used in DBS. Optics is another core area we
   apply in neurosurgery. Several optical probe systems for intraoperative
   guidance have been developed. Forward-looking probes can act as ``vessel
   alarm{''} by recording the tissue's microcirculation with laser Doppler
   flowmetry during creation of the brain trajectories in relation to
   stereotactic neurosurgery. In DBS this method has been evaluated in the
   clinical setting in more than 100 implantations. For brain tumor
   biopsies the method is presently introduced in combination with 5-ALA
   fluorescence measurements at the tumor border. 5-ALA induced
   fluorescence spectroscopy- and microscopy can also be used together in
   brain tumor surgery. Under the neurosurgical ``blue-light{''}
   microscope, a hand-held probe supports the surgeon by enhancing
   malignant tissue. Another challenge is optical monitoring of cerebral
   microcirculation in the neuro-intensive care setting. A prerequisite for
   successful project outcome is a close collaboration between biomedical
   engineers and neurosurgeons. difference.
   Objectives: The main goal of this study was to synthesize
   polysaccharide-based hydrogel systems that favor bone regeneration. The
   hydrogel formation is driven by Schiff base crosslinking reaction
   between the amino functionalities of carboxymethyl chitosan (CMChi) and
   the aldehyde groups of the different oxidized polysaccharides resulting
   in an imine bond formation. Methods: Different amounts of NaIO4 were
   used in order to oxidize Alginate (ALG) and Hyaluronic acid (HA),
   forming reactive dialdehyde derivatives with different oxidation
   degrees. The amount of aldehyde groups was determined by: A) using
   Schiff's reagent and detected by a UV-Vis spectrometer (550nm) and B)
   acid base titration after reacting the aldehyde groups with
   Hydroxylammoniumchloride. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) was used
   for molecular weight determination of the different polysaccharides.
   Biocompatibility of the products was tested using Qblue (R) assay and
   CFDA staining. Results: Data obtained from both UV-VIS spectroscopy and
   titration show that the different polysaccharides have more aldehyde
   groups when high concentrations of NaIO4 were used and the reaction
   times were extended. The weight average molecular weights of all the
   products were lower after the oxidation step. Products with high
   oxidation degrees showed low biocompatibility. Discussion: ALG and HA
   with high oxidation degrees are required to prepare stable hydrogel
   systems and the dual utility of using CMChi and oxidized polysaccharides
   as both structural and bioactive component is promising for the
   formation of biocompatible hydrogel systems that can be used for bone
   tissue regeneration.
   Objectives: Xenotransplantation of transgenic porcine pancreatic islets
   offers a promising alternative source to circumvent current limitations
   posed by the scarcity of allogeneic donors. However, either immune
   rejection or oxygen supply in immune protected encapsulated islets
   remains a major concern. To decrease xenogeneic immune responses, we
   have investigated the feasibility to generate tissue engineered SLA
   silenced islet cell clusters (ICC) from alpha-Gal knock out, CD46, CD55
   and CD59 transgenic minipigs. Methods: Pancreatic islets single cell
   suspensions were generated by enzymatic digestion of porcine ICCs. The
   single cells were silenced for SLA class I and II by lentiviral vectors
   encoding for Nanoluciferase as reporter gene and for short hairpin RNAs
   targeting beta2-microglobulin (shb2m) or class II transactivator
   (shCIITA), respectively. SLA transcripts were evaluated by real-time PCR
   and protein levels by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy
   analyses. Cell death was evaluated by Propidium Iodide staining. The
   effect of SLA class I silencing was evaluated in human T and NK cell
   cytotoxicity assays. SLA-silenced pancreatic beta-cells were then used
   to form new ICCs in stirred bioreactors. Results: SLA class I silencing
   was designed to reach a level of up to 86\% and class II by up to 64\%
   on pancreatic islet cell monolayers. Silencing SLA expression did not
   affect cell viability and the insulin-producing beta-cell phenotype as
   indicated by Dithizone staining and levels of insulin production.
   Xenogeneic T-cell immune responses (p<0.05) as well as antibody-mediated
   cellular-dependent immune responses (p<0.01) were significantly
   decreased. Silencing SLA class I expression did not increase
   susceptibility to NK-cell cytotoxicity. In stirred bioreactors, tissue
   engineered islets showing the typical 3D-structure and morphology of ICC
   were assembled from SLA-silenced pancreatic cell suspensions to be used
   for transplantation in humanized mice as a first model. Discussion:
   These data shows the feasibility to generate low immunogenic porcine ICC
   from transgenic pigs after single cell engineering and post-
   transduction islet reassembling that might serve as a robust alternative
   to allogeneic pancreatic islet cell transplantation.
   Objectives: In patients with circulatory support, preload is a valuable
   clinical monitoring variable. While it is difficult to measure directly,
   it can be indirectly measured by PCWP or left atrial pressure (LAP).
   Typically, assessments of LAP require invasive methods. However,
   non-invasive estimation of LAP can be a useful tool for monitoring
   patients and adjusting pump speed to reduce the likelihood of hazardous
   events, such as ventricular suction and pulmonary congestion. This study
   presents an artificial neural network model estimating the LAP
   noninvasively across different patient conditions. Methods: LAP was
   estimated based on the HeartWare HVAD pump characteristics (current,
   flow and speed) derived from 186 experiments performed in a mock
   circulatory system with HVAD speed range from 1800 to 3600 rpm. The LAP
   estimation was evaluated by measuring the hemodynamic variables in
   response to a range of changes to the mock cardiovascular system,
   including changes in PVR, SVR and HR. A neural network was trained with
   70\% of the data (randomly chosen), and was validated and tested with
   the rest of data. The model performance was quantified by the mean
   squared error (MSE), correlation coefficient (r2) and Bland-Altman plot
   between measured and estimated LAP in different scenarios. Results: The
   neural network model was able to estimate LAP accurately using data
   collected in-vitro for training, validation and test sets. The MSE for
   all data is 1.36 mmHg, and correlation coefficients are 0.99, 0.91 and
   0.94 for training, validation and test sets, respectively. The
   Bland-Altman plot showed that error has a bias of 0.28 mmHg with a
   reproducibility coefficient of 2.2 mmHg. Discussion: The developed model
   would be useful for a real-time estimation of preload noninvasively
   which can be employed to adjust pump speed in heart-failure patients
   without inserting a pulmonary catheter into the pulmonary artery.
   Implementation of the developed estimator would also create a new
   physiological control system that can work noninvasively.
   Objectives: Blood vessels are integral to the maintenance of all
   tissues. They deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste. Blood
   vessels not only contain endothelial cells (ECs) that are in direct
   contact with flowing blood cells and fluids but they may also have
   pericytes and smooth muscle cells on the outside that stabilize and
   regulate their size. Defects in EC and pericyte/smooth muscle cell
   interaction are often implicated in many pathological conditions.
   Patients with a genetic disease called hereditary hemorrhagic
   telangiectasia (HHT) suffer from heavy and recurrent nosebleeds, due to
   unstable blood vessels as a result of defective interaction between ECs
   and pericytes. Methods: Here we used human induced pluripotent stem
   cells (hiPSCs) as a source of patient-specific cells, as they can be
   derived from all individuals, including children and patients with
   genetic disease and subsequently differentiated towards all cells of the
   body. Besides, we can now use hiPSCs to derive all the component of
   blood vessels in large numbers and use them to re-create blood vessels
   on a chip to model inflammation and disease. Results: HHT-hiPSC-ECs
   displayed no apparent functional differences using a set of standard
   two-dimensional (2D) assays. The ability of hiPSC-ECs to form a perfused
   microvascular network was next examined using three-dimensional (3D)
   cultures in microfluidic chips. Using these 3D vessels on a chip, we
   found that in contrast to 2D microvascular cultures, the ability to form
   3D microvessels in microfluidic chips was strikingly compromised when
   HHT-hiPSC-ECs were used compared to isogenic control ECs. Discussion:
   This patient-based hiPSC model thus serves as the first proof of
   principle that vascular diseases could be modeled using patient-specific
   hiPSCs in 3D microfluidic chips and to identify new target cells and
   possible pathways for therapy.
   Objectives: This study was aimed at fabricating various layer-by-layer
   (LbL) systems using glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) with the capability to
   bind BMP-2 specifically in order to control osteogenic differentiation
   of cells by biocompatible release systems. Methods: Heparin, chondroitin
   sulfate and their oxidized forms as polyanions were combined with
   chitosan and collagen I as polycations to form various multilayer
   coatings on model materials with the advantage of the intrinsic
   cross-linking formed between oxidized glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and
   polycations, improving multilayer stability and affecting the release of
   BMP-2. The myoblast cell line C2C12, which can differentiate into
   osteoblasts was seeded on 5 mu g/mL BMP-2 loaded multilayers. Cell
   viability, adhesion, osteogenic differentiation and BMP-2 release were
   investigated. Results: C2C12 cells cultured directly on the top of
   multilayers showed that particularly BMP-2 loaded multilayers made of
   oxidized GAGs promoted an osteogenic differentiation that was nearly
   comparable to the positive control, when 5 mu g/mL BMP-2 was added
   directly to the medium. Interestingly, the BMP-2 had synergistic effect
   on cell adhesion and spreading. BMP-2 in oxidized chondroitin sulfate
   multilayers was successfully loaded to the layers, sustainably released
   over time and affected cell differentiation more than the soluble BMP-2.
   Discussion: The results show that oxidized GAGs forming intrinsically
   cross-linked multilayers are useful as reservoirs for sustained release
   of BMP-2 in which the intrinsic cross-linking affected BMP-2 release,
   improved multilayers stability due to the resulting stiff surface
   compared to the native ones, supported cell adhesion, proliferation and
   subsequent differentiation. This can pave the way for coating implants
   and scaffolds for repair and regeneration of bone fractures.
   Objectives: Functional myocardial recovery during support with left
   ventricular assist devices (LVADs) is highly desirable but only observed
   in approx. 1\% of all patients. Previously, the more frequently
   implanted pulsatile blood pumps (PBPs) showed higher recovery rates than
   the currently used rotary blood pumps (RBPs). The aim of this study was
   to comparatively assess the capability of PBPs and RPBs to unload the
   left ventricle and restore physiological cardiac energetics in isolated
   hearts. Methods: An RBP (Medtronic HVAD) and a heartbeat synchronized
   PBP (BerlinHeart Excor) were alternately connected to eight isolated
   porcine hearts. To modulate the mode of LVAD support, RBP rotational
   speed was set to different support levels and ejection delay of the PBP
   was phased from 0\% to 90\%. Pressures, flows, left ventricular volumes,
   and myocardial oxygen consumption were recorded and cardiac efficiency
   quantified by the ratio of external work (EW) over myocardial oxygen
   consumption. Results: With increasing RBP support, lower left atrial
   pressures (LAP) were found to coincide with a decreased cardiac
   efficiency (r=0.91 +/- 0.12) with a median {[}inter quartile range]
   slope of 0.28 {[}0.91] \%/mmHg. In contrast, depending on the phase
   delay of ejection of a PBP, LAP and cardiac efficiency follow a
   sinusoidal course with the LAP minimum at 90\% and efficiency maximum at
   60\%. Discussion: In RBP support, aggressive ventricular unloading was
   found to lead to lower cardiac efficiencies. On the other side, phasing
   of a PBP offers the possibility to restore cardiac efficiency and
   simultaneously unload the ventricle. These results may justify future
   studies linking optimized cardiac mechanics and efficiency to functional
   recovery and reverse myocardial remodeling with LVAD therapy.
   Objectives: We focused on the interventricular dyssynchrony caused by
   the shortened systole of left ventricle (LV) compared to right ventricle
   (RV) during left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. The purpose
   of this study was to assess and quantify the mechanical interventricular
   dyssynchorny according to the support condition using conductance
   catheter. Methods: We studied five goats with normal heart condition. A
   centrifugal LVAD was implanted under general anesthesia. We inserted the
   conductance catheter into the LV and RV and obtained the pressure-volume
   relationship. We defined the dyssynchronous status by the sign (plus or
   minus) of the LV volume (LVV) change is opposite to that of RV volume
   (RVV). (i.e., (dLVV/dt){*}(dRVV/dt)<0). Interventicular dyssynchrony
   (DYS) was quantified by calculating the percentage of time within the
   cardiac cycle. Bypass rate was set dividing the LVAD pump flow by the
   main pulmonary artery flow. We calculated the DYS under LVAD support
   with various bypass rate. Results: The mean DYS of normal heart, LVAD
   clamp, LVAD support with bypass rate of 50\%, 75 \% and 100\% were 6.0
   +/- 1.3, 8.6 +/- 2.6, 9.6 +/- 1.8, 15.5 +/- 5.6, and 24.6 +/- 8.6,
   respectively. Also, there was a higher linear negative correlation
   between LV stroke volume and DYS. Discussion: Interventricular
   dyssynchrony during LVAD support was assessed and quantified using
   conductance catheters. Dyssynchrony became significant when the LV was
   unloaded with high rotational speed under LVAD support. Assessment of
   influences for the right ventricular function and heart failure models
   will be studied in the further study.
   Objectives: (Bio)chemical modification of implants with drug delivery
   systems can support the body's natural healing capabilities by imitation
   of smooth tissue transitions along bone-tendon conjunctions. Modified
   interconnected 3D porous poly(epsilon-caprolactone) could act as a
   scaffold material for these implants. Methods: Cocontinuous blends of
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) were
   prepared by batch blending in an internal mixer. Annealing and leaching
   of the blends with water yielded the porous PCL scaffolds, which were
   then modified with chitosan (CS) grafted PCL (CS-g-PCL) via dip coating.
   Nanoparticle systems containing CS and tripolyphosphate (TPP) were
   obtained via ionotropic gelation. These CS-TPP nanoparticles (CSNPs) can
   be attached to the modified scaffolds via a Layer-by-Layer (LbL)
   deposition approach involving alginate (ALG). Results: Interconnected 3D
   porous PCL scaffolds with different morphologies have been prepared.
   Modification with CS-g-PCL, alginate, alginate fluorescein amine
   (ALG-FA), CS-TPP and fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled nanoparticles
   (CS-FITC-TPP) in a LbL approach was carried out. The blank scaffolds
   were analyzed in various ways, including via scanning electron
   microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Modified versions of the
   scaffolds were analyzed accordingly and the fluorescently labeled
   species were investigated via confocal laser scanning microscopy. CSNPs
   were loaded with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and layered on the modified
   scaffolds. Release of BSA from the scaffolds was investigated by
   ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy at 37 degrees C in phosphate-buffered
   saline (PBS). Discussion: Porous PCL scaffolds with different pore sizes
   and morphologies can be obtained via annealing and leaching of
   cocontinuous PCL/PEO blends. Surface modification with CS-g-PCL,
   alginate and CSNPs open up possibilities regarding graded implant
   fabrication.
   Objectives: Vascular calcification is accelerated and worsened in
   chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dialysis patients compared to the
   general population. Misbalanced phosphate and calcium metabolism plays
   an important role in this health burden in CKD. In this study the role
   of phosphate and calcium in inducing medial vascular calcification is
   researched. Methods: Rat aortic rings were incubated in the normal and
   calcifying mediums for seven days. Three independent experiments, three
   rings per condition in each, were performed (N=9). Normal medium
   consisted of DMEM with 0.9 mM phosphate and 1.8 mM calcium. Calcium
   medium (Ca) consisted of 4.0 mM calcium and 0.9 mM phosphate; phosphate
   medium (P) of 2.8 mM phosphate and 1.8 mM calcium; and calciumphosphate
   medium (Ca+P) of 4.0 mM calcium and 2.8 mM phosphate. Histochemical von
   Kossa staining was performed, and calcification area of a medial and
   adventitial section of the aorta was calculated. The results were
   compared using a two-way ANOVA test. Results: Von Kossa stainings and
   evaluations of the calcified area demonstrated increased calcification
   in aortic rings incubated in different calcification mediums, whereas
   the calcification takes part in different sections of the aorta. Calcium
   alone causes calcification in the adventitia, phosphate alone in the
   medial section of the aorta. Combination of both leads to extensive
   calcification in the adventitia and media. Discussion: In dialysis
   patients, serum calcium levels are maintained quite well, but serum
   phosphate levels may exceed suggested levels multiple times. The results
   of the study demonstrate that high phosphate level is the trigger of
   excessive vascular calcification and the control of levels of phosphate
   in CKD patients is crucially important.
   Objectives: Heterogeneously structured electrospun composite scaffolds
   have performed well as ECM-mimetic tissue replacements in recent years.
   In light of this, we present an assessment of amnion derived multipotent
   stromal cell (aMSC) growth on hybrid polycaprolactone(PCL)-gelatin(G)
   scaffolds in terms of viability, infiltration depth and metabolic
   activity. Methods: Four scaffold types were electrospun (150 mu m thick)
   with different PCL:G ratios and fibre diameter distributions using
   vertical (V) and horizontal (H) orientations - PCL175V (175 mg/ml,
   homogenous), PCL125G50H (125:50 mg/ml, homogeneous), PCL125G50V (125:50
   mg/ml, heterogeneous), PCL100G75V mg/ml (100:75 mg/ml, heterogeneous). A
   7 day live/dead assay and a 15 day infiltration study (depths measured
   using confocal laser scanning microscope) with aMSCs from Callithrix
   jacchus were performed. Metabolic activity was measured by MTT assay (7
   days). Additionally, gelatin loss during scaffold degradation (30 days)
   was measured by Raman spectroscopy. Results: In general, PCL-gelatin
   blends perform better than unblended PCL. PCL125G50V shows the deepest
   cell infiltration on all days (76.3 +/- 7.1 mu m by day 15). It is also
   the only sample that shows an increasing trend in metabolic activity
   from day 1 (0.0436 +/- 0.002) to day 7 (0.0996 +/- 0.009). Raman
   spectroscopy revealed a significant gelatin loss of 53.44 +/- 6.48 \% in
   PCL100G75V while PCL125G50V showed no significant loss by day 15.
   Discussion: A combination of heterogeneous fiber morphology and
   composite polymer content in electrospun scaffolds positively affects
   cell growth and infiltration. Considerable gelatin swelling during
   degradation can physically inhibit infiltrating cells. Therefore,
   choosing the right ratio of PCL:gelatin when designing such scaffolds is
   key.
   A total artificial heart is used for orthotopic replacement of the
   native ventricles in cases of irreversible biventricular heart failure
   resulting either from chronic dilated cardiomyopathy or fulminant acute
   myocardial infraction. It is essential to find the right indication.
   There are several surgical options to perform a total artificial heart
   operation. To prevent therapy-failure it essential to set the right
   indication for implanting a total artificial heart. In general therapy
   with a TAH is feasible with good postoperative results. Setting the
   right clinical frame is crucial for the establishment of a therapy
   concept.
   Objectives: Although diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal
   disease in many countries, data about its impact on patient-specific
   reaction to haemodialysis (HD) is scarce. Models that allow identifying
   and predicting patient-specific response to HD are in development and
   their improvement is encouraged by clinicians to obtain suitable
   decision support systems (DSS). Here, possible correlations between
   diabetes and alterations in the patient-specific parameters identified
   by a multi-pool, multi-solute model, developed in our laboratory, are
   investigated. Methods: Data acquired during the `DialysIS' Interreg
   Project (141 patients, 4 centres, 1276 HD) have been used. For each
   patient, a set of specific parameters was identified: one modulates the
   permeability at the capillary wall (rho), the others account for altered
   transport of catabolites and electrolytes at the cellular wall (k(i))
   and at the dialyser membrane (eta(i)), where `(i)' indicates different
   solutes. Patients have been classified as diabetic (D) or not (ND) and
   among Ds, as insulin-dependent (D\_ID) or not (D\_NID). Initial glucose
   concentrations and identified values of rho, ki, eta i in the different
   groups have been compared using proper statistical tests (p<0.01).
   Results: There were were 37 (26,4\%) D patients and 16 of them were
   D\_ID (43,2\%). Initial plasma glucose concentration statistically
   differs both between D and ND and between D\_ID and D\_NID patients.
   Among the patient-specific parameters rho, and K-Na, K-Mg, K-Creatinine
   and K-Bicarbonate results were different between D and ND. The values of
   eta(Na), eta(Mg), eta(Ca), eta(Urea) and eta(Creatinine), instead,
   significantly differ between D\_ID and D\_NID. Discussion:
   Diabetes-induced autonomic and peripheral neuropathies can justify the
   finding of altered capillary wall permeability in D; moreover the use of
   insulin, protein based, seems to impact on the mass transport through
   the dialyzer membrane. The proposed approach allows adding a new tile to
   the studies on how the diabetic pathology affects the response to the HD
   treatment.
   Objectives: Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) therapy has become an
   accepted treatment for end-stage heart-failure. While patient management
   has improved over the past decades, limitations in caregiver resources
   necessitate efficient allocation. Decisions on the optimal setting of
   LVAD support currently occurs in intervals ranging from a few weeks to a
   few months. However, the optimal setting for LVAD support may change
   multiple times per minute. Thus, automation is the only viable solution
   to this problem. Physiological control promises to integrate the cardiac
   assist device into patient physiology even more closely, reacting to
   varying demands or specifying the load for training of the heart muscle.
   One important design consideration is the choice of feedback variable.
   Methods: Literature of the past two decades was collected and the
   presented physiological control concepts were clustered into categories
   corresponding to functional similarity of feedback variables. Results:
   It was found that most literature could be summarized into five
   categories. Control algorithms either used preload, heart rate,
   ventricular contraction, or afterload as feedback variables or modified
   the flowrate/headpressure relation. Discussion: Each of these categories
   contains information about the cardiac state. While preload variables,
   most closely resemble the native functioning of the left ventricle, they
   are inherently difficult to measure without using additional sensors.
   Chronotropic incompetence might be a limiting factor for heart rate
   based control. Ventricular functioning might fluctuate over time due to
   changes in inotropy while afterload is heavily regulated by other
   autoregulatory mechanisms. The headpressure/flowrate relation suffers
   from uncertainty regarding the origin of pressure changes. Combining
   elements of these five categories into one control concept might prove
   beneficial, as different information could be extracted for the
   controller, which could then be tuned by the physician.
   Objectives: Current understanding of membrane performance in
   hemodialysis implies that their permeability in terms of molecular
   weight cut-off must be restricted to a figure below the molecular weight
   of albumin, i.e. < 60.000. Nephrologists commonly request a maximal
   allowable albumin loss during a 4h treatment to be below 4g per session.
   Methods: Recent investigations have shown that the 3D-conformation of
   albumin is unstable and changes in e.g., uremia or liver failure. Thus,
   detoxification efficiency of albumin may decrease by about 70\% and can
   be explained by a considerable reduction of albumin's binding constants
   for both pharmaceutical drugs and uremic retention solutes, as well as
   for exogenous toxins. As a result, free concentrations of such solutes
   increase in patient's blood and a higher toxicity is observed. Binding
   constants for defined uremic retention solutes, such as p-Cresylsulfate,
   are further affected by the simultaneous presence of other solutes, such
   as Indoxylsulfate. Results: Oxidative stress, as manifested in many
   dialysis patients, further promotes changes in albumin conformation.
   It's thus no surprise, that hemodialysis with protein-permeable
   membranes improves patient performance, as shown recently in a clinical
   trial by Nagai et al., (Ther Apher Dial, 2017; 21:378). They reported,
   that in a 7-year observation period, albumin leakage of 3g or more per
   HD session provided a better prognosis than albumin leakage less than
   3g. Obviously, a clinically acceptable large albumin leakage provides
   beneficial effects on maintenance HD patients. Discussion: The
   performance of albumin as an adsorbing protein is inefficient during
   uremia and liver failure. Due to lower binding constants for
   pharma-drugs and uremic toxins following conformational changes in the
   sick state, albumin is unable to perform like in the healthy state. It
   should, thus, be removed. Identification of 3D-changes of albumin and
   thus its removal should become a priority.
   Cataract surgery followed by implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL)
   is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in medicine.
   In 2020 alone, there are expected to be 32 million interventions. Here,
   ophthalmologists can look back on 70 years of experience. Since there is
   no blood perfusion at the lens, however, the IOL has a comparatively
   simple immunological special position. Furthermore, the ophthalmologists
   also have extensive experience with implants in the cornea, in the
   chamber angle of the eye and on the retina. In the presentation an
   overview will be given of the current implants and the necessary
   regulatory processes. In addition, own experiences (with medical
   devices) with the new requirements of the MDR will be described.
   Recent evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) suggests that
   post-dilutional haemodiafiltration (HDF) is associated with a benefit in
   survival. This benefit has been mainly observed in re-analyses of the
   primary data looking at the patients treated with the highest convection
   volumes (HCV-HDF). To obtain HCV-HDF, significant pressure has to be
   applied to the dialyser membrane and the dialysis systems are submitted
   to significantly stronger transmembrane pressure (TMP) constraints,
   frequently surpassing the limits proposed by the guidelines. Several
   automatized systems are proposed to avoid or overcome the alarms induced
   by the increases in convection and still maintain the volumes prescribed
   by the physician. The present overview will
   i) Critically analyse the evidence on the effect of convection volumes
   on survival. ii) Review the automatic systems presently proposed to
   achieve a given level of convection. iii) Analyse the possible pitfalls
   in determining the limits established by a dialysis monitor when
   performing HCV-HDF. iv) Explore a harmonised definition of the
   parameters that may drive the convection volumes during a dialysis
   procedure with the aim to help in better defining the Best Practice
   Guidelines for HCV-HDF.
   Objectives: Human Parvovirus B19 (HPV B19) infection is known to cause
   pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in kidney transplant recipients. We
   investigated the diagnosis and prognosis of HPV B19 infection by urine
   detection in kidney transplant patients with anemia and graft
   dysfunction. Methods: 1195 recipients (living donor/donation after
   citizen's death: 492/703) were performed kidney transplant in our center
   from January 2015 to January 2018. Thirty-six patients diagnosed with
   HPV B19 infection during follow-up (3.01\%, 36/1195). Among those,
   fourteen HPV B19 infected patients underwent transplanted kidney biopsy,
   including 12 persons with PRCA and graft dysfunction and 2 recipients
   with donor-derived HPV B19 infection. We collected the urine samples for
   detection of HPV B19 DNA copies at the day of kidney biopsy. Meanwhile,
   the biopsy specimen were studied for immunohistochemical detection by
   using polyclonal mouse Anti-Parvovirus B19 antibody. Results: The mean
   diagnosis time of fourteen HPV B19 infected patients was 44 days
   (7-300days) after transplantation. The reticulocyte percentage was
   0.1-0.2\% and the mean hemoglobin level was 67 g/L (51-87 g/L). Among 12
   biopsies with PRCA and graft dysfunction, 6 were diagnosed with T
   cell-mediated rejection (IA-IB-IIA), 3 borderline rejection, 2 without
   rejection signs and 1 was diagnosed with thrombotic microangiopathy
   (TMA). The patient, who was diagnosed with TMA, had performed
   ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation. It displayed glomerular
   microthrombus and diffuse necrosis of renal tubules on renal biopsy.
   Despite the treatment of IVIG, the graft was ultimately lost. The
   immunohistochemical result of the TMA biopsy specimen was positive and
   the others were negative. The result of urine detection for HPV B19
   virus DNA copies was >10 boolean AND 5/ml with TMA and the others were
   negative. Discussion: If the urine test is positive for HPV B19 DNA,
   parvovirus -associated kidney injury should be suspected.
   Hemodynamic simulations are increasingly used to assess the flow
   phenomena in intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Based on detailed simulation
   results existing therapies such as coiling or stenting can be improved
   or novel approaches are tested. However, the accuracy of
   patient-specific blood flow acquisitions strongly depends on preliminary
   and highly interdisciplinary steps. These include for instance medical
   imaging, image reconstruction, image segmentation and acquisition of
   appropriate boundary conditions. To assess capabilities, but also
   limitations of state-of-art IA modeling techniques, international
   simulation challenges are frequently organized. These comparisons
   address single or combined steps along the simulation process. Within
   this talk, the most relevant competitions are presented and the main
   findings are summarized. In this regard, sources of error in the context
   of hemodynamic modeling are revealed and the awareness for standardized
   simulations is sharpened.
   Objectives: Heart failure (HF) is a critical healthcare issue and a
   primary source of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Globally, it is
   estimated that up to 100,000 people are candidates for heart
   transplantation, but only about 5800 transplants were performed in 2016.
   At Cleveland Clinic, we are developing a continuous-flow total
   artificial heart (CFTAH) in an attempt to provide a viable alternative
   to transplantation for the growing population of patients with end-stage
   HF. Methods: The Cleveland Clinic CFTAH is a double-ended centrifugal
   pump with only one moving part that is designed to passively
   self-balance left and right circulations without active intervention.
   The device has no mechanical bearings to wear out and is driven by an
   extremely reliable 3-phase brushless, sensorless motor. The nominal
   external dimensions of the latest version of our adult CFTAH design to
   be tested in-vivo were 98.4 mm in length, 62 mm in diameter, 160 cc in
   volume displacement and 486 g in weight without the cable. Results:
   Biocompatibility of the CFTAH has been demonstrated in two full-term
   90-day in vivo tests, completed without the use of any anticoagulation.
   Since the conclusion of these tests, our team has been working on design
   improvements to further reduce susceptibility to thrombosis, enhance
   autoregulation, improve motor controller hardware, add clinically useful
   features to the control interface and enhance manufacturability.
   Discussion: Our results to date suggest that a small, mechanically and
   electronically simple, auto-regulated total artificial heart has
   significant potential to provide an important clinical option for HF
   patients.
   We discuss a novel method for hemolysis prediction in computational
   fluid dynamics, which avoids potential problems inherent to the
   traditionally used Eulerian and Lagrangian methods. The traditionally
   used Eulerian method computes a hemolysis index (HI) at the flow outlet
   by solving a transport partial differential equation (PDE) where the
   source term equals shear stress raised to some power (which is
   determined empirically), and then looks at the HI transported to the
   flow outlet. The largest contribution to HI typically occurs at the flow
   boundaries (walls), which is precisely the location where numerical
   noise is most likely to be inadvertently introduced, e.g., from sharp
   edges in the wall or from low quality mesh elements. This can cause
   errors in the Eulerian method because its PDE lacks a diffusion term,
   and consequently any numerical noise is transported to, and accumulates
   at, the flow outlet surface. We have not seen this potential problem
   occurring when using a Lagrangian method, although theoretically it
   could still occur. Regardless, a major disadvantage of the Lagrangian
   method is a large computational cost required to achieve reasonable
   accuracy. Instead of using one of the two traditional methods, we use a
   volume integral where the source term includes both shear stress and
   flow speed. In situations with sufficient mixing, such as in an LVAD,
   this approach predicts blood damage at least as well as either of the
   other methods, for a fraction of the computational cost, and avoids the
   numerical problems. The method also lends itself better to frozen rotor
   simulations, while the traditional methods prefer more costly
   time-dependent simulations. We present an example where the method is
   used to evaluate potential changes to a HM3-like rotor design.
   Objectives: A great and long pursued goal in cancer research is the
   development of a suitable culture system for expanding haematopoietic
   stem cells (HSCs), which can thereafter be successfully used in
   transplantations. Since HSCs only reproduce in their natural
   environment, novel systems try to mimic the in vivo niche of HSCs, the
   bone marrow, in many factors such as material rigidity, chemical and
   cellular compositions. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are known
   to support HSC expansion. This effect is even greater when the cells are
   cocultured in a 3D environment. The aim of this project is to study the
   interactions of HSCs and MSCs in a conventional 2D culture compared with
   a 3D porous hydrogel, which was previously developed in our group.
   Methods: The influence of HSCs on MSCs and vice versa will be studied on
   a transcriptomic level by next generation sequencing and verified by
   qPCR, cytokine arrays and western blots. To regain the cells from the
   system we want to make our hydrogel degradable by introducing disulfide
   bonds, which can be cleaved by reducing agents. Afterwards the RNA will
   be fixed within the cells and these will be separated by magnetic cell
   sorting, previous to RNA isolation. Results: Previous experiments
   indicate that the 3D system has a positive effect on HSCs only in
   coculture with MSCs. With a deep insight into the transcriptomes of both
   cell types in coculture, we hope to identify key molecules playing a
   role in this phenomenon and in HSC expansion. Such key molecules shall
   further be tested for their influence on the coculture by inhibition or
   enhancement. Discussion: The HSC expansion in vitro while maintaining
   their stem cell character has been a major and challenging goal in
   research for more than 60 years. By finding and influencing key
   molecules of the HSC-MSC interaction, we hope to further develop our 3D
   hydrogel system and increase HSC expansion in vitro.
   Objectives: Small molecule drugs can be bound to plasma proteins.
   Examples are Apixaban (459 Da, 87\% protein bound), Carvedilol (406 Da,
   98\% protein bound) or Calcitriol (416 Da, 99.9 \% protein bound). In
   plasma, these drugs have a free and a protein bound fraction. Protein
   binding impacts the removal behavior of the drug during dialysis. The
   purpose of this work was to develop a quantitative model to describe the
   removal of these solutes, and validate the model experimentally.
   Methods: A mathematical model was developed by coupling the equations of
   transport in dialyzers reported in one of our previous studies, and mass
   balance equations reported in literature to include the effect of
   binding. Simulated HD treatments with human plasma were performed with 3
   different types of commercial dialyzers having different membrane
   permeability to study the removal of Apixaban, Carvedilol or Calcitriol,
   expressed in terms of solute clearance. Additionally, the loss of
   albumin was quantified. Results: Experimental clearance results
   {[}ml/min] are given as mean +/- MAD from 3 independent experiments in
   the order of Apixaban / Carvedilol / Calcitriol. Calculated values are
   reported in brackets. Dialyzer 1 was tested in HDF mode, yielding
   clearance of 60 +/- 1.0 {[}61] / 41 +/- 1.8 {[}10]/ < 6 {[}0.5].
   Dialyzer 2 tested in HD mode yielded clearance of 60 +/- 1.6{[} 60] / 31
   +/- 1.6 {[}10] / Discussion: Clearance of tested drugs was lower than
   expected for their nominal molecular weight. The levels scaled Apixaban
   > Carvedilol >> Calcitriol, which is inverse to their degree of protein
   binding (Apixaban < Carvedilol << Calcitriol). The degree of protein
   binding was revealed to be the actual critical determinant, rather than
   dialyzer design and operational mode. Drug clearance seemed to be driven
   by the proportion of the free fractions, as is reflected in the model by
   the increase of clearance for decreasing bound fraction.
   Objectives: In the development of biocompatible materials for biomedical
   applications, the foreign body response is an important issue. The
   healing of surrounding tissue often interferes with the function of an
   implanted biomaterial. Events like protein deposition, hemostasis,
   inflammation, tissue repair, infections and the encapsulation of the
   functional part of the implant are the main cause of failure of the
   implanted device. Methods: In this study biocompatible nanofilms are
   produced by means of a plasma polymerization process using a
   low-pressure magnetron-enhanced 15 kHz glow discharge. This process
   allows the precise control of the film nature and behaviour. The
   resulting hydrocarbon film has a thickness of a few nanometer and keeps
   therefore the inherent properties of the substrate material.
   Measurements on protein adsorption gave the possibility to tailor the
   thin films in the needed direction. This means to tailor a native
   secondary structure of in situ adsorbed proteins. Results: The nanofilms
   were investigated using different surface analytical methods. Also the
   interaction in contact with different biological sample materials was
   tested in-vitro. The precise measurement of the adsorbed proteins
   indicated a native secondary structure of proteins on these surfaces.
   Different in-vivo sensor dummies which are in contact with blood and
   soft-tissue were coated by these nanofilms. The explanted sensors were
   kept free of any encapsulation by this coating. This stands in good
   correlation with the measurement of adsorbed proteins. Discussion: The
   first in-vitro results of the adsorption of blood proteins indicated
   already a very biocompatible character of these nanofilms. The explanted
   sensors were kept free of any encapsulation by this coating. These
   coatings can open the door for many new applications in the field of new
   implants but also other biomedical products.
   Objectives: Human placenta tissue has great advantages to be used as
   tissue source due to its molecular composition and its availability as
   clinical waste product. In our previous studies, human placenta arteries
   were decellularized and showed low immunogenicity and a supportive
   environment for cell migration and proliferation. Decellularized
   extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels are a widely-used tool in the field
   of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. To create placental ECM
   hydrogel (pECM-HG) decellularized arterial grafts were further processed
   by an enzymatic pepsin digestion. Methods: pECM-HG were biochemically
   analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize fiber
   structures. Cell adherence and migration assays were carried out on
   pECM-HG coated culture plates to confirm cytocompatibility of the
   material. As next step pECM-HG was used for coating of vascular grafts
   in a reseeding experiment using a perfused 3D bioreactor system.
   Furthermore, biomechanical properties of 3D hydrogels were tested by
   rheological measurements. Results: pECM-HG showed low amount of DNA
   residuals and preservation of cell interacting ECM proteins. SEM
   analysis revealed the formation of specific fibrous structures,
   dependent on respective hydrogel concentration. Cell binding and
   viability assays showed significantly enhanced cell adherence and
   increased proliferation rates when seeded on surfaces coated with
   pECM-HG (p<0.001) compared to controls. pECM-HG showed beneficial
   properties for cell reseeding on acellular vascular grafts in a flow
   bioreactor system. Discussion: We developed a hydrogel from human
   vascular tissue that is cytocompatible and supports cell adherence and
   proliferation. We hypothesize that this hydrogel has great potential due
   to its origin and composition. Further investigations on the hydrogel
   composition are ongoing. It is planned use the pECM-HG for 3D cell
   printing applications or as injectable hydrogel to support ischemic
   injury regeneration.
   Objectives: Intra-aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) is undoubtedly the most
   widely used mechanical circulatory support system for a range of severe
   heart failure indications. Average duration of IABP use is 1-3 days,
   however its longer-term use has not been adequately studied. The
   objective of this work is to establish the extent to which the IABP
   duration has been used, and also to examine the clinical outcome
   pertaining to prolonged use of IABP, using meta-analysis of literature
   data. Methods: We defined IABP prolonged use as 7 days or longer; a
   choice based on a duration that is greater than double the current
   perceived average use. We systematically reviewed the literature
   (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science) and identified 14 studies that have
   prolonged IABP use between 1968 - 2018. Patients indications included
   heart failure (refractory, congestive, end stage), ventricular
   arrhythmia, myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. Results: A
   total number of 1707 patients of both genders received prolonged IABP
   use with an overall average of 22.6 days. The studied cohort is split
   into: Group 1: n= 1683 adults, mean age 57.9 years, range 19-84 years
   old, average use of 21.2 days. Survival rate in this group was 64.4\%.
   Group 2: n=24 infants and children, mean age 5.5 years, range 7
   days-17.5 years old, average use 24 days. Overall mean survival rate to
   discharge was 62.5\%. At a mean follow-up of 85 months, all 15 survivors
   were alive and well. Discussion: Due to its ease of insertion and
   relative low cost, IABP presents the first port of call in a wide range
   of heart failure scenarios. This analysis indicates that, age does not
   seem to be a significant parameter that affect outcomes of IABP
   long-term use. Although, IABP is perceived to be only a short-term
   support, its prolonged use is evident with successful outcomes. Further
   trials of IABP long-term use for children and adults is warranted to
   further establish the range of indications IABP can be utilised as a
   long-term support.
   Objectives: Human serum albumin (HSA), one of the dominating proteins in
   human plasma with its exceptional binding capacity plays an important
   role in storing and transporting different substances throughout the
   human circulatory system. Clinically used to treat a variety of
   diseases, particularly in liver failure therapy, pharmaceutical-grade
   HSA contains high amounts of stabilizers, such as Na-caprylate and
   N-acetyltryptophanate. These compounds represent potential risks to
   patients with restricted liver function. The aim of this study was to
   test if the elimination of stabilizers by adsorbent technique affects
   HSA's secondary structure. Methods: Albumin infusion solutions (BIOMED,
   Germany) were filtered using a commercial system Hepalbin (Albutec,
   Germany). Raman- and FTIR spectroscopy as well as DSC analysis were
   applied to analyze conformational changes in treated and untreated HSA
   samples. For Raman based studies different parameters such as object
   slides type, integration time, accumulations number and laser capacity
   were investigated. Results: Preliminarily results of the
   physical-chemical analyses showed some differences for filtered samples
   in comparison to the unfiltered ones. Raman and FTIR spectra exhibited
   both, peak shifts in characteristic HSA amide bands and an alteration in
   the peaks' shape. DSC thermograms revealed significant differences in
   denaturation temperatures of the compared samples. Discussion: A Raman
   shift in amide I band and changes in the alpha-helix/beta-sheet ratio
   detected via FTIR spectroscopy indicated a possible alteration in the
   HSA conformation after filtration. These findings were corroborated by
   DCS showing a tendency towards lower denaturation temperatures in
   samples after stabilizers removal. The results may contribute to finding
   a compromise between stability and high functional performance of HSA
   for the improvement of liver failure therapy.
   Objectives: The protein fibrinogen is important in blood coagulation and
   wound healing. Hence, nanofibrous fibrinogen scaffolds are highly
   attractive as biomaterials. One currently used technique to prepare
   fibrinogen nanofibers in vitro is electrospinning. Since this technique
   uses organic solvents and high electric fields, which can impede the
   biological protein function, we have developed a novel technique to
   prepare fibrinogen scaffolds with physiological buffers. Methods: We
   introduced the novel method of salt-induced self assembly under
   controlled drying conditions to prepare nanofibrous fibrinogen
   scaffolds. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was used to
   characterize the fiber morphology. We studied the secondary structure
   with Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. To assess the
   biocompatibility of our novel scaffolds we analyzed the proliferation of
   3T3 mouse fibroblasts with WST1 assays and studied the cell morphology
   with SEM. Results: Salt-induced self assembly reproducibly yielded
   fibrinogen nanofibers with overall scaffold dimensions in the centimeter
   range. SEM analysis revealed fiber diameters between 200 and 300 nm. By
   adding a customized fixation step after the fiber formation we
   fabricated either immobilized or free-standing fibrinogen networks
   depending on the underlying substrate material. With FTIR spectroscopy
   we found a higher content of beta-sheet structures for fibrinogen
   nanofibers in comparison to planar fibrinogen. 3T3 fibroblasts were
   found to proliferate well on fibrinogen nanofibers with cell numbers
   comparable to planar fibrinogen substrates. SEM analysis showed that 3T3
   fibroblasts grew in close contact with fibrinogen nanofibers.
   Discussion: Our new self assembly process offers a well controllable and
   physiological biofabrication method for large-scale fibrinogen
   scaffolds. Based on the good biocompatibility results our fibrinogen
   networks are very promising candidates for a new class of wound
   dressings.
   Total artificial hearts (TAH) are used to restore quality of life to
   biventricular heart failure patients but can also introduce significant
   risks. Several features were included in to the BiVACOR design to
   mitigate some of the major risks, such as 1) device malfunction, 2)
   insufficient hemocompatibility, 3) ineffective physiological
   interaction, and 4) inappropriate device geometry. To achieve a durable
   design the BiVACOR TAH reduces mechanical wear by levitating a single
   rotating impeller in a magnetic field. To reduce the incidence of single
   fault failures, the levitation and drive systems incorporate backup
   features. Large clearance gaps in the blood flow path and cyclic speed
   variations assist hemocompatibility. Physiological interaction is
   improved via autonomous left/right outflow balancing, the ability to
   inherently adapt total outflow based on physiological conditions, and to
   respond to variations in filling volumes. Initial durability testing is
   ongoing with no device failures after 180 days. The redundant motor and
   hydrodynamic backup bearing maintain hemodynamic function when failure
   modes are induced. Preliminary NIH, platelet activation and vWF
   degradation during in-vitro tests show lower levels than implantable
   VADs. In-vivo results (1x90day, 3x30-day) confirm benchtop observations.
   When operated with either pulsatile or non-pulsatile outflow up to 15
   l/min, or with the hydrodynamic backup bearing, pfHb ranged between
   0.5-2mg/dL. The system can balance outflows under a wide variety of
   physiological conditions, while inherently adjusting flows by more than
   4 l/min. Finally, device weight and size allowed a good anatomical fit
   in human cadavers with BSA >1.4m(2). By implementing the risk mitigating
   design features, the BiVACOR device aims to provide patients with a
   durable, hemocompatible, and physiological interactive TAH with suitable
   anatomical fit. Successful development of this device may ultimately
   lead to a long-term alternative to heart transplants.
   Objectives: Visualization of hemodynamics often represents a
   simplification of blood as a monophasic fluid. In this study, blood is
   used as a multiphase fluid. The aim is to fabricate artificial blood to
   visualize hemodynamics with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). More
   specific, micro beads (ArtErys), which mimic the erythrocytes, are
   fabricated with a membrane-emulsion-technology system (MET). This system
   is developed and compared with the results (e.g. ArtEry size) of three
   other methods: microfluidic, electro-spraying and air flow. Methods: The
   ArtErys are made of hydrogels (Agarose 0.3-0.7 wt.\%) to match
   refractive index and biomechanics. For PIV tracking, particles
   (Sphericals (c), 20 mu m) are encapsulated directly into the ArtErys and
   are not added to the plasma where they might affect the hemodynamics.
   For the MET system, different oils (e.g. paraffin) are used as disperse
   phase. The Agarose/PIV mixture is pumped (50 to 100 ml/h) into a
   constant oil flow (5 to 40 ml/h) through a PTFE membrane (Reichelt
   Chemietchnik GmbH, pore size 60 mu m). The ArtErys are created during
   this process and transported away by the oil. The MET process is carried
   out in a heated water bath with a temperature of 55 degrees C. Results:
   The ArtEry size depends mainly on two parameters: the flow rate of the
   agarose/PIV solution and the flow rate of the oil. A flow rate of 80
   ml/h Agarose/PIV solution leads to smallest bead sizes with a mean
   diameter of 150 mu m. High rates lead to merging of the ArtErys, which
   is reflected in a larger diameter. Furthermore, the bead size depends on
   the parameter oil flow rate. Here, a rate of 30 ml/h leads to the
   smallest beads. Discussion: The MET method has been successfully
   implemented to fabricate ArtErys with encapsulated PIV particles.
   Compared to the other methods, the MET system fabricates the biggest
   ArtEry sizes (MET: 150 mu m, microfluidic: 15 mu m, electro-spraying: 80
   mu m, air flow: 100 mu m).
   Objectives: Since the latest revision of the Medical Devices (MDs)
   Directive, the European regulatory framework considers stand-alone
   software as a MD per se, as confirmed by the MD Regulation. The recent
   surge of AI tools, which promise to be ubiquitous soon, poses problems
   relative to their certification as MDs. In view of the already granted
   market approval in Europe and the USA for some AI-based MDs, we aimed to
   investigate the main relevant issues of such MDs' regulation. Methods:
   Unlike traditional SW as MDs, for which established standards already
   exist (e.g., IEC 62304, ``Software life-cycle processes{''}), for AI
   tools there are very few specific standards. The definition of AI, or
   intelligence itself, is by no means universally accepted. Thus, we
   limited the scope of AI to Machine/Deep Learning (ML/DL). Results: 1)
   ML/DL tools are data intensive, so that a critical issue is how to
   construct a representative set of input data. E.g., IEC 62304 recommends
   that the manufacturer include software system inputs and outputs, in the
   SW requirements: this is clearly too generic for a DL tool. 2)
   Guidelines for acceptable input data size should be drawn, for a given
   system/software architecture. Moreover, quality check of training data
   should always be executed, before SW training. Quality of ML/DL tools
   and of physical architecture is also relevant. 3) Generally, DL tools
   lack an explicit declarative knowledge representation, hence it is
   difficult or impossible to assess to ``reasoning{''} behind the
   algorithmic decisions. ``Explainable{''} AI should be the standard, in
   order to rule out fuzziness in machine clinical decision making and
   impossibility to pinpoint the problem(s), in view of the legal
   responsibility for MD use. It has been found that DL performance
   conflicts with explainability, thus priority setting will be crucial.
   Discussion: The regulatory treatment of AI-based MDs needs improvements,
   in order to have safe and effective products, as well as wider societal
   acceptance.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to design a reliable and efficient
   sheath for an implantable part of a device for the wireless inductive
   powering of artificial organs. Methods: Wireless inductive power
   transfer can help get rid of the problems of recharge and wired constant
   power supply to artificial organs. However, the design of the
   implantable part of the transcutaneous powering device, or so-called
   assembly, is complicated by the lack of a comprehensive solution of
   technical and medical problems. The assembly must be encapsulated in the
   sheath which requires the choice of a biocompatible and non-magnetic
   material. This eliminates the formation of eddy currents on the sheath,
   whereby negative influence on the energy transfer is minimized. At the
   same time, the material should have a low thermal conductivity (about
   0.5 W / (m . K)) to prevent overheating of the tissue from the
   circuitry. The sheath of the assembly must have sufficient durability to
   protect the circuitry. The form-factor of the sheath should be minimized
   for the convenience of the patient (dimensions in the limit of 20 x 20 x
   3 mm). Results: The sheath was developed for the assembly prototype. The
   assembly provides an output power in the range 0.45 horizontal ellipsis
   0.55 W for the axial distance between the coils in the range 10
   horizontal ellipsis 20 mm and the lateral misalignment up to 20 mm. The
   calculation and measurement were performed in the air and with the
   samples of ``skin-fat{''} biological objects, in order to determine and
   verify the sheath characteristics. Discussion: We have developed and
   tested the assembly's sheath for inductive powering of artificial organs
   that meets technical and medical requirements.
   Objectives: Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are used in medicine for
   targeted drug delivery to the area of cancer. There is the problem of
   remotely determining in vivo concentrations of MNPs. The aim of our work
   was to experimentally test acoustomagnetic method (AMM) for detecting
   MNPs in a model sample of a biological substance (BS). Methods: A
   colloidal solution of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in a mixture of oleic acid and
   kerosene was used as a model sample. The weight concentration of the
   MNPs in the solution was 0.15\%, and the viscosity of the solution was
   close to the blood viscosity. To detect MNPs in solution, a special
   experimental setup was developed. The installation consists of an
   ultrasound generator, a permanent magnet, a glass container with a
   solution, an induction multi-turn coil near the glass tube, and a
   voltmeter as a measure of the voltage across the coil. Ultrasound causes
   periodic movement of the particles of the solution together with the
   MNPs along the container axis. The magnet orients the MNPs in the
   direction perpendicular to the axis of the container. As a result, the
   summation of MNPs creates an alternating magnetic field with an
   ultrasonic frequency in the coil area. An alternating voltage (U) arises
   on the coil, as measured by a voltmeter. Results: As measurements have
   shown, the magnitude of the voltage is proportional to the concentration
   of MNPs in the field of action of the ultrasound and the magnet field,
   as well as the intensity of the ultrasound. In particular, when the
   intensity of ultrasound was at the level of 0.02 W/ cm2, U = 1mV was
   obtained. Discussion: The experimental results are consistent with the
   calculated estimates and suggest that AMM can be used to detect MNPs in
   a real BS. Considering that the magnitude of the constant magnetic field
   in these experiments was 0.1T, we can also conclude that this method is
   safe, more accurate, and easier to implement than traditional X-ray and
   MRT methods.
   Objectives: For a single hemodialysis session several hundred liters of
   water are consumed. Water scarcity and inadequate water purification
   facilities worsen contamination risk especially in developing countries.
   Here, we investigate the application of a mixed matrix membrane (MMM),
   which combines filtration and adsorption, for achieving endotoxin-free
   dialysate combined to high removal of uremic toxins from human plasma.
   Methods: We investigate the adsorption of lipo-polysacharide (LPS) by a
   MMM in both static and dynamic conditions. Dynamic adsorption of LPS is
   also investigated in presence of uremic toxins in human plasma.
   Diffusion experiments using dialysate contaminated with bacterial
   culture filtrates are also performed to assess the ability of the MMM to
   act as a safety-barrier to avoid transfer of pyrogens to the plasma. A
   membrane without sorbents is used as control and the obtained results
   are compared with literature studies using current dialysis membranes.
   Results: The MMM can remove approximately 10 times more endotoxins from
   dialysate compared to commercial dialysis membranes. No transfer of
   pyrogens was detected in the blood compartment, revealing safety-barrier
   properties of the MMM. Importantly, endotoxins from dialysate and
   protein-bound toxins from human plasma can be removed simultaneously
   without compromising AC adsorption capacity. Discussion: We estimate
   that 0.15 m(2)of MMM is needed to remove the daily production of the
   protein-bound toxins, indoxyl sulfate and hippuric acid and to
   completely remove endotoxins in a wearable artificial kidney (WAK)
   device. Future studies would focus on the applicability of the MMM in
   wearable/portable artificial kidneys and in general for
   home-hemodialysis treatments.
   Objectives: Nearly half of all heart failure patients suffer from heart
   failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). With no effective
   treatment, a major clinical need is presented. The aim of this study was
   the hemo - and fluid dynamic investigation of a valveless pulsatile pump
   for HFpEF using in-vitro, ex-vivo, computational fluid dynamic (CFD),
   and 4D flow MRI imaging studies. Methods: The pump is a pneumatically
   driven pulsatile pump with a single valveless cannula that is to be
   implanted through the LV apex and is operated synchronously with the
   left ventricle. A prototype of the proposed pump system was fabricated.
   The pump was tested in an in-vitro hybrid mock loop system to evaluate
   its hemodynamic effect in four HFpEF phenotypes. Further hemodynamic
   evaluation was conducted by implanting the pump in an ex-vivo isolated
   heart model. CFD was employed for flow field analysis of two different
   pump designs-a symmetric and an asymmetric configuration. The results
   were validated by 4D flow MRI imaging of the respective prototypes.
   Results: In the in-vitro studies, the pump augmented cardiac output (CO)
   by 14 - 30\% and reduced left atrial pressure (LAP) by 14 - 30\%.
   Ex-vivo studies showed the similar hemodynamic trends: augmented CO by
   20.0 +/- 9.7\%, and reduced LAP by 57.5 +/- 14.4\%. Fluid dynamic
   simulations revealed good correlation with the respective 4D flow
   measurements. The asymmetric configuration disclosed superior fluid
   dynamic performance with 94.5\% of the initial blood being exchanged
   after 3 beats. Discussion: It was demonstrated that the valveless
   pulsatile device can improve hemodynamics in HFpEF patients by
   augmenting CO and reducing LAP. Appropriate washout of the pump chamber
   is achieved by a persisting vortex evolving within the asymmetric design
   throughout each pump cycle. By demonstrating the hemodynamic effects and
   promising fluid dynamic performance of the pump, feasibility of the
   system as a potential treatment option for HFpEF patients is supported.
   Objectives: In this work, the denaturation behaviour of bovine serum
   albumin (BSA) in single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) aqueous
   nanodispersions during heating was analyzed using differential scanning
   calorimetry. Thermodynamic effects of BSA interaction with SWCNTs have
   been discussed. The calculation procedure for estimating the parameters
   of laser treatment on the basis of differential scanning calorimetry
   data is presented. Accurate calculation of the optimal parameters of
   laser treatment, under which there is complete denaturation of albumin
   and the solid nanocomposite material is forming, will minimize the
   thermal damage of the connected tissues, while not reducing the tensile
   strength of the seam. Methods: Laser solders based on water dispersion
   of BSA (25 \% w/w) and SWCNTs (0, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 \% w/w) were used
   for differential scanning calorimetry study. Studies were conducted in
   hermetically sealed crucibles with heating rates of 3, 5, 10 and 20
   degrees C/min. Results: The specific energies and denaturation
   temperatures of the laser solders were measured. The use of SWCNTs led
   to a decrease in the specific energy of denaturation from 4.11 to 3.27
   J/g and a denaturation temperature from 87.2 to 86.9 degrees C. The
   activation energy of albumin denaturation in laser solder has doubled
   during use SWCNTs Discussion: Thermodynamic effects of BSA interaction
   with SWCNTs have been discussed, namely the changes in temperature
   characteristics of denaturation processes and the partial thermal
   destabilization of albumin. The energetic parameters of laser treatment
   have been estimated on the basis of differential scanning calorimetry
   data. The values obtained are optimal for complete BSA denaturation
   resulting in formation of solid nanocomposite material with minimal
   thermal damage of the connected tissues and sufficient tensile strength
   of the seam.
   Objectives: Clot formation in the membrane oxygenator is a serious
   complication in long-term extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In
   the blood vessels, nitric oxide (NO) generated by nitric oxide synthase
   on the endothelial cells suppresses both aggregation/activation of
   platelets and adhesion/activation of leukocytes. Therefore,
   biocompatibility of the membrane oxygenator may be improved by the
   addition of NO gas to the sweep gas. The objective of the present study
   was to determine, using a rat ECMO model, whether addition of NO gas to
   the blood can suppress blood coagulation. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley
   rats weighing 350 to 400 g were used for the experiments. After the rats
   were anesthetized, extracorporeal circulation was established by guiding
   the blood from the right jugular vein into the left femoral vein.
   Heparin was administered by bolus injection (0.7 unit/g-rat) only at the
   start of the ECMO. Polymethyl pentene membranes were used for the
   oxygenator. The sweep gas (NO: 0, 100 or 200 ppm, O2: 30\%, CO2: 5\%,
   N2: balance) was added to the blood via the oxygenator. During the
   experiment, the arterial pressure, oxygenator inlet pressure, venous
   pressure, activated whole blood clotting time (ACT), and methemoglobin
   (Met-Hb) concentration were measured. After circulation, the hemoglobin
   (Hb) content and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the eluate from
   the residual blood in the oxygenator were measured. Results:
   Extracorporeal circulation was stably performed for 4 hours. There were
   no differences in the ACT during the experiment among the three groups.
   The amount of Met-Hb was below 10\% in the NO group. The Hb content and
   LDH activity in the eluate were significantly lower in the 200-ppm NO
   group than those in the 0 ppm NO. Discussion: The amount of Met-Hb in
   the NO group indicates that there is no adverse effect related to
   Met-Hb. The Hb content and LDH activity indicate that the NO contained
   in the sweep gas inhibited blood coagulation in this rat extracorporeal
   circulation model.
   Objectives: Data from the WAA apheresis registry was investigated
   regarding patients treated with extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) as a
   tool to modulate immune response in various diseases. Methods: 381
   patients (34\% women) had been treated with ECP for a total of 10668
   procedures. The mean age was 48 years (+/- 18, range 3-81 years).
   Estimation of quality of life was made using grade 0 (suicidal) up to 10
   (best ever) and health quality grade 1 (Bed ridden, ICU condition) up to
   10 (athletic). Adverse events were analyzed. ANOVA comparisons were
   used. Results: Most patients were treated due to graft versus host
   disease (GVHD, n=284) and other hematological diseases (n=34). Adverse
   events were registered in 5.8\% of the first treatments and in 2.1\% of
   the subsequent procedures. Severe adverse events were present in 0.4\%
   of all procedures. No patient died due to the procedure. Tingling and
   stitching were the most common side effects. For those with GVHD the QoL
   was initially at a mean 6.3 (+/- 1.5, range 2-10) and improved
   significantly within 10 procedures and the Health Condition estimate
   improved significantly within 9 procedures and improved further with
   added procedures. Discussion: Photopheresis is an established therapy
   with few side effects. The present data indicate that approximately 10
   procedures are necessary to note significant effect to GVHD.
   Objectives: The most fundamental goal in improving quality of care in
   hospitals is to eliminate unnecessary deaths. AIM: Three-year mortality
   and quality of care between 2015-2017 were evaluated in a tertiary
   nephrology clinic. Methods: Audit of 392 deaths was carried out to
   reveal prevalence of suboptimal clinical observations. Admission
   pressure, direct admissions avoiding public healthcare system, severity
   of clinical conditions, elderly persons dying in the hospital, time of
   admissions and death were evaluated. Results: In 2015 and 2016, 5.5 of
   every 100 inpatients died in the hospital, and this proportion decreased
   to 4.9 in 2017, with high percentage of patients who died in the first
   24 or 48 hours from admission. The percentage of hospital deaths
   occurring in combination with AKI rose from 17\% up to 37\% over the
   three-year study period. Many patients who died with worsening CKD, were
   not ever referred to a nephrologist. More than half of patients were
   admitted on duty and died over weekends. About 5\% of the hospital
   deaths were among patients aged 85 and over, and in 2017 that number
   rose up to 10\%. Patients who died were seriously ill, at least 17\% had
   malignancy. Most of the cardiovascular deaths were directly caused by
   ischemic stroke. Discussion: In this study we did not find patients with
   preventable deaths. The results indicated that patients were seriously
   ill, elderly, some being admitted to hospital to die. Some of the
   patients were kept long period prior to death because of shortage on
   certain facilities. There is admission pressure and other external
   factors contributing to high burden in treatment of the dying patients.
   Still, further effors are necessary for further providing and auditing
   health quality of care.
   Objectives: Human immune cells have been produced using Advanced Therapy
   Medicinal Products (ATMP) guidelines and have been tested in clinical
   studies for a number of diseases, for which still no or only inadequate
   alternative therapies are available. Examples include several cancer
   entities, stroke, myocardial infarction, severe autoimmune disorders and
   chronic infections. Despite many in vitro or in animal studies report
   positive outcomes after immune cell therapy, convincing results showing
   the benefits of ATMP in clinical studies are rare. Part of this
   discrepancy in the outcome of the clinical studies in comparison to the
   in vitro and in animal studies may be caused by the manufacturing of
   immune cells for clinical trials. Cells prepared for clinical trials
   were mostly manufactured using archaic, scarcely controlled and
   incomparable production processes and stringent analytical methods for
   assessing proliferation and differentiation of the immune cells during
   the manufacturing process were not applied. Methods: The production of
   ATMPs is first of all dependent on the donor specific biology, which
   significantly varies from one donor or patient, respectively, to another
   (biological heterogeneity). In case of immune cell therapy, the
   manufacturing process is key for cytotoxic function and is the basis for
   the biological activity of the cells after injection into the patient.
   Results: The challenge for future clinical trials therefore is to
   reproducibly provide a sufficient number of biologically active cells of
   appropriate quality preferably in accordance with quality manufacturing
   guidelines (e. g. Good Manufacturing Practice, ICH etc.). Only using
   cells which have been produced under these rigorous quality control
   regimes will allow the conduction of clinically meaningful trials.
   Discussion: The talk presents a survey and discusses consequences on
   future requirements for manufacturing processes of products for immune
   cell therapies.
   Objectives: Cryopreservation plays a major role in the storage of
   tissues that are kept for subsequent transplantation. A wide variety of
   tissues intended for transplantation for a patient are stored in this
   way. In addition to the assignment to a suitable recipient, it must be
   ensured in particular that a sufficiently long period of time is
   available for infection diagnostic analyses. Cryopreservation of tissue
   is therefore routine in everyday tissue medicine. Methods: As is well
   known, the success of low temperature storage depends in particular on
   coordinated freezing and storage processes, in the optimization of which
   many research approaches have already been investigated. In contrast to
   these well-known principles of important parameter adjustment in this
   context, little attention is paid to optimizing the freezing process in
   the daily routine of tissue medicine. In fact, for some applications the
   suboptimal storage of tissue is not critical, as no vital cells are
   necessary or desired. Results: This reduces the process to a minimum and
   eliminates the need for additives such as cryoprotective agent (CPA) or
   animal/human serum. This is particularly important for tissue
   preparations which, as in Germany, require a medicinal product approval
   by a competent authority. Any change to the process must be first
   approved by the competent authority, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI).
   Optimizing the freezing process would therefore entail a new approval
   procedure. If the changed process was not previously known in the EU, a
   clinical study is also required. Discussion: For this reason, the
   conditions are not improved in case of doubt, although it is known that
   this could lead to a higher quality of the tissue after thawing. Less
   toxic CPA could simplify the approval procedure and thus contribute to
   improved tissue storage for transplantation. The same applies to the
   cryopreservation of tissue engineered products.
   Vascular access is a key issue for survival for uremic patients that
   need acute or chronic dialysis. In acute settings the use of central
   venous catheters, holding two luminae, are most commonly used in the
   intensive care for continuous or intermittent hemodialysis. Such
   catheters may be of acute type or a chronic type containing a separate
   cuff to limit bacterial invasion into the vessels. Another option is to
   place a peritoneal dialysis catheter into the abdominal cavity. If using
   the right technique, this catheter can be surgically inserted in local
   anesthesia and could be used directly postoperatively for acute but also
   chronic peritoneal dialysis. For chronic hemodialysis (HD) the
   preferable option is to place an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) at the
   lower arm. This results in enlargement of the vein, and partly fibrosis,
   that allows for frequent punctures leaving no material externalized
   after the end of a HD procedure. A problem is the development of
   vascular stenosis and thrombosis that need interventions in at least
   50\% of patients within one year. When the AVF fails an option is to
   insert a graft (AVG). This may be either a biologic or synthetic graft
   interpositioned between the feeding artery and a more proximal vein
   below the elbow instead of the local vein that usually is occluded. If
   this option even fails, the patient has to rely on a sufficient
   permanent central dialysis catheter where complication such as bacterial
   contamination and occlusions are problems. To avoid such catheters a
   dream for future would be a graft as AV access that is made of an
   autologous biodegradable material that has physiological characteristics
   that prevent stenosis and clotting and also is possible to easy correct
   in its diameter to adjust for the volume of blood returned/minute to the
   heart to avoid congestive heart failure.
   Objectives: It has been observed that the in-vivo dialyser clearance for
   small solutes is not constant during a hemodialysis (HD) session. This
   may influence the choice of the value to be measured and reported. We
   investigated the presence of trends in the clearances of urea and
   creatinine, and how it impacts their values. Methods: Diffusive
   clearances were calculated for urea and creatinine from dialysate
   concentration data measured in 25 patients who underwent 3 consecutive
   HD sessions each. Clearance values were obtained for each hour (at 0,
   60, 120, 180, 240 minutes). The significance of the observed trend in
   the data was statistically tested, as was any difference between the
   values at 2 and 3 hours, and the average clearance during the session.
   Results: Urea clearance showed an overall increase from the start of HD
   (by +10.1 +/- 19.3 mL/min, p = 0.0002) while creatinine clearance
   decreased (by -30.7 +/- 17.1 mL/min, p < 10(-4)). For urea, there was,
   however, a significant increase during the first hour (by +26.5 +/- 16.3
   mL/min, p < 10(-4)) which was not observed for creatinine. Starting from
   2 hours, both clearances decreased significantly, but the overall drop
   for creatinine was twice that for urea (by -34.1 +/- 15.7 vs. -16.3 +/-
   19.8 mL/min, p < 10(-4)). As a consequence of these different trends,
   clearance at 2 h, 3 h, and the time-average clearance were not
   significantly different for urea (199.2 +/- 25.9 mL/min, p = 0.18),
   whereas they were so for creatinine (2 h: 115.9 +/- 26.3 mL/min vs. 3 h:
   106.2 +/- 29.2 mL/min vs. average: 109.7 +/- 26.1 mL/min, p < 10(-4)).
   Discussion: A decrease in clearance during HD can be expected because of
   the progressive clogging of the dialyzer membrane's pores. It is not
   clear however the reason for the higher decrease in creatinine compared
   to urea. Our results suggest anyway that the time at which creatinine
   clearance is measured in-vivo should be clearly reported, as the
   difference during the session might be as high as 30\%.
   Objectives: Currently, there are no reliable internal treatment options
   for large segmental bone defects. The objective of this study is to
   develop an alternative treatment for a young male patient with a huge
   180mm diaphyseal tibial bone defect, who was already recommended
   amputation. Methods: A modular add-on system is developed for a
   commercially available motorized bone lengthening nail (Ellipse
   Technolo-gies, USA). The system allows bifocal segmental transport of
   osteotomized bone segments. By this, the bone defect is filled from two
   sides. A wire rope hoist shall ensure that the bone can overcome the
   distance from both sides, which re-duces the time of healing and the
   amount of implanted parts. A 3D-printed model of the patient's bone
   segments helps to design the implant system itself and the handling
   which includes fixation, transport and explantation. Results: The
   results show in accordance to previous studies that the developed
   implant system effectively transports both osteot-omized transport bone
   segments. The wire rope hoist mechanism and the modular construction
   works as planned. The implant system can be explanted successfully.
   Discussion: In this study, we present an individualized modular add-on
   implant solution. The advantage of the modular setup is that many parts
   can be manufactured in universal sizes. This method of bone
   reconstruction could help many patients, who suffer from large critical
   size defects.
   Among the various possible embodiments of Advanced Therapies and in
   particular of Tissue Engineering the use of temporary scaffolds to
   regenerate tissue defects is one of the key issues. The scaffolds should
   be specifically designed to create environments that promote tissue
   development and not merely to support the maintenance of communities of
   cells. To achieve that goal, highly functional scaffolds may combine
   specific morphologies and surface chemistry with the local release of
   bioactive agents. Many biomaterials have been proposed to produce
   scaffolds aiming the regeneration of a wealth of human tissues. We have
   a particular interest in developing systems based in biodegradable
   polymers. Those demanding applications require a combination of
   mechanical properties, processability, cell-friendly surfaces and
   tunable biodegradability that need to be tailored for the specific
   application envisioned. Those biomaterials are usually processed by
   different routes into devices with wide range of morphologies such as
   biodegradable fibers and meshes, films or particles and adaptable to
   different biomedical applications. In our approach, we combine the
   temporary scaffolds populated with therapeutically relevant communities
   of cells to generate a hybrid implant. For that we have explored
   different sources of adult and also embryonic stem cells. We are
   exploring the use of adult MSCs, namely obtained from the bone marrow
   for the development autologous-based therapies. We also develop
   strategies based in extra-embryonic tissues, such as the perivascular
   region of the umbilical cord (Wharton's Jelly). We are currently
   involved in a European consortium aiming at developing films with
   antimicrobial properties to be used in hospitals to cover surfaces that
   are prone to facilitate the transmission of infections. Those films use
   surface topographies and natural-derived oils to ensure the needed
   antibacterial properties to the films. This talk will review our latest
   developments of functionalized biomaterials and scaffolds in combination
   with stem cells for advanced biomedical devices and therapies.
   Objectives: Corwave LVAD is being developed to employ gentle oscillation
   of a membrane to propel blood, based on the wave motion of swimming
   fish. The pump output can be readily tuned by adjusting membrane
   oscillation frequency and magnitude. The purpose of this project was to
   increase the hydraulic efficiency, implement a physiologic pulsatility
   control algorithm, and confirm performance in animal implants. Methods:
   The fluid path of the pump was simulated by Fluid-Structure-Interaction
   (FSI) computational fluid dynamic analysis in COMSOL. Membrane size,
   oscillation frequency, oscillation magnitude, and the blood flow path
   were modeled and refined to improve hydraulic performance and eliminate
   areas of flow stagnation. Pumps were then tested in blood analogs and
   blood in mock circulation loops and in vitro hemolysis testing.
   Non-hermetic prototype pumps were implanted in a total of 25 sheep for
   acute and chronic implants. Results: Design simulations and individual
   component testing resulted in a pump which can generate 6+ LPM of blood
   flow against physiologic pressures with maximum shear rates orders of
   magnitude lower than those of rotary blood pumps. Mock loop testing
   demonstrated the pumps have ``flat{''} HQ (pressure vs. flow) curves.
   Three control methods were developed: fixed, asynchronous pulsatile, and
   synchronous pulsatile. Pulsatile modes generated dP/dt>400 mmHg/s using
   sensorless detection of native ventricle systole. Animal implants
   demonstrated low hemolysis and an absence of renal infarcts, but were
   limited to about a week in duration due to the non-hermetic sealing of
   the pumps. Discussion: Application of robust computational simulation
   and bench top testing have produced a unique new kind of VAD, offering
   the flow capacity and reliability of rotary pumps, but adding
   physiologically relevant pulsatility without excessive shear rates.
   Future efforts will implement full hermeticity to extend animal study
   durations and confirm von Willebrand Factor compatibility.
   Objectives: To investigate the colonization potential of Ovine
   Endothelial Progenitor Cells (OEPCs) on thermoplastic silicone-based
   polyurethane (TSPU) polymer under static condition. Methods:
   Functionalised TSPU (F-TSPU) was prepared by first subjecting the TSPU
   nonwovens to plasma treatment, followed by sterilization with 70\%
   ethanol for seven minutes and then coupling with VEGF under sterile
   conditions. TSPU without any additional treatment or modification,
   identified as NF-TSPU, were used as control. OEPCs were seeded at the
   density of 5x10(4) cell/cm(2) onto square 4 cm(2) sized polymers under
   static conditions. Samples were taken at three time points: 1, 3 and 7
   days. Samples were examined through live/dead staining and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) to check the progression of cellular
   colonization on the polymer. MTS assay was used to quantify the
   metabolic activity of the cells on the polymer. Results: Cells seeded on
   the polymer surface were clearly visible on the SEM images. On day 3,
   the cells could be observed as patches on surface but did not cover all
   the surface. By day 7, the cells had almost filled the polymer surface.
   In case of F-TSPU, at Day 7, the underlying fiber pattern of the polymer
   could be observed on the cell sheet covering the polymer. Whereas this
   feature was not seen for NF-TSPU, indicating that the cells attached
   firmly to F-TSPU compared to NF-TSPU. Bright green fluorescence was
   observed on samples that underwent live/dead staining, indicating
   presence of live cells. Only a few red spots, representing dead cells,
   were seen. The metabolic activity on NF-TSPU was quantified to be higher
   than in the F-TSPU, though the difference was not statistically
   significant. Discussion: Static cell seeding experiments showed that
   OEPCs were able to attach and grow on the surface of both types of TSPU.
   These are promising results suggesting that TSPU holds potential for
   engineering of a new generation of heart valve prostheses, which will be
   assessed in pre-clinical animal models in the near future.
   Objectives: To investigate the impact of rotational speed modulation on
   VAD hemodynamics by comparing the effects induced by the artificial
   pulse in the HeartMate 3 (HM3, Abbott Laboratories, USA) to those
   induced by the Lavare cycle in the HeartWare HVAD (Medtronic Inc., USA).
   Methods: We compared the effect of speed modulation to a baseline case
   with constant speed and pressure head in both HM3 and HVAD using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD simulations employed high
   spatial (10(7) elements) and temporal (2 degrees per time step)
   resolution and one-way coupling to a lumped parameter model (LPM) of the
   cardiovascular system for physiologic boundary conditions. Lagrangian
   particle tracking was implemented to probe viscous and total stresses
   along cell paths. Results were validated against experimental
   pressure-flow (HQ) curves. Results: LPM results showed that HM3 and HVAD
   follow drastically different HQ loops during speed modulation,
   reflecting differences in pump characteristics, modulation rate and
   magnitude and associated fluid inertial effects. In the HM3, pump flow
   varied between -1.2 and 8.8 L/min during the artificial pulse vs. 3.7 to
   7.1 L/min in the HVAD during the Lavare cycle. Induced aortic pressure
   pulses were comparable (11.3 vs 13.2 mmHg). CFD results revealed higher
   baseline shear stresses in the HVAD than in the HM3, coherent with
   previous studies. In both pumps, stresses were highest during flow
   acceleration. Sudden flow deceleration during the artificial pulse
   destabilized the flow and thereby also increased turbulence and total
   stresses on particles. Discussion: While speed modulation may contribute
   to pump wash out and pulsatility, it may also increase flow disturbances
   and shear. By relating shear stress to the rate and magnitude of the
   speed changes, this study sheds light on the impact of the imposed
   accelerations on the stress fields. This is of relevance for the
   establishment of both built-in and physiologically-controlled speed
   modulation sequences.
   Objectives: Thrombotic deposition is a major consideration in the
   development of implantable cardiovascular devices. Recently, it has been
   demonstrated that fluid mechanical shear micro-gradients play a critical
   role in thrombogenesis. The goal of the present work is to develop a
   predictive computational model of platelet activation and deposition
   that can be used to assess the thrombotic burden of cardiovascular
   devices. We have developed a comprehensive model of platelet-mediated
   thrombogenesis which includes platelet transport in the blood flow,
   platelet activation induced by both agonists generated at sites of
   vascular injury and shear micro-gradients, kinetics and mechanics of
   platelet adhesion, and changes in the local fluid dynamics due to the
   growth of a thrombus. Methods: A 2D computational model was developed
   using the multi-physics finite element solver COMSOL 5.3a. The model can
   be described by a coupled set of convection-diffusion-reaction
   equations, and it comprises 7 species: resting and activated platelets,
   agonists that induce thrombosis, and an anticoagulant agent. Platelet
   adhesion at the surface was modeled via flux boundary conditions. Using
   a moving mesh for the surface, thrombus growth and consequent
   alterations in blood flow were modeled. In the case of a stenosis, the
   notions of shear stress-induced platelet activation in the acceleration
   zone and platelet deposition in the expansion zone downstream of the
   stenosis were studied. Results: The model provides the spatial and
   temporal evolution of thrombosis in the flow field. The computed density
   of platelets adherent to the surface was validated against experimental
   data. The results confirm the importance of considering both mechanical
   and chemical activation of platelets. Discussion: The developed model
   represents a potentially useful tool for the optimization of the design
   of the cardiovascular device flow path.
   Objectives: The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of glucose
   concentration in the culture medium on metabolism and viability of the
   human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) co-cultured with the
   human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (HUASMC) on polysulfone
   semipermeable flat membranes. Methods: Cells were isolated from
   umbilical veins and arteries obtained by Caesarean section. Membranes
   with a surface area of 2 cm2 were covered with fibronectin to promote
   cells' attachment and then were placed in specially designed inserts.
   Cultures were carried out in 12-well plates filled with culture medium
   containing glucose in normal (5 mM) or high (20 mM) concentration. The
   HUVEC and HUASMC were seeded on separate membranes or on both sides of
   the same membrane with density of 4,600 cells/cm2. Cultures have been
   conducted in standard conditions (37oC, 5\% CO2) for 7 days. Activity of
   the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell viability were analyzed using
   the flow cytometry (with DCFDA test and Annexin V / 7AAD test,
   respectively). Microscopic visualization of cells was made after
   fixation in formalin using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results: In
   the HUVEC co-cultured with HUASMC the ROS activity was lower by 17\% in
   the normal than in high glucose concentration. In normal glucose
   concentration the ROS activity of the HUVEC co-cultured with HUASMC was
   lower by 8\% than in HUVEC cultured separately, whereas in high glucose
   concentration it was higher by 19\%. Viability of HUVEC cultured
   separately in normal glucose concentration was higher by 4\% than in
   high glucose concentration. Microscopic visualization of cells did not
   reveal any morphological differences. Discussion: In terms of the ROS
   activity the obtained preliminary results indicate a beneficial effect
   of HUASMC on HUVEC co-cultured in normal glucose concentration. The
   opposite tendency was observed in high glucose concentration.
   Objectives: Continuous rhythm monitoring is useful for predicting,
   determining and treating a large class of diseases. An implantable heart
   monitor is useful for this purpose. it has small dimensions and records
   events over a timeframe measured in years. The objective of the study is
   to develop methods and algorithms for determining QRS-complexes and
   disorders in the work of the heart. Methods: Several sources were used
   to obtain the ECG: large collections of recorded physiologic signals
   PhysioBank and BioModule BioHarness 3. Records of database have
   annotations with tags of QRS-complexes and conclusions of doctors.
   BioModule BioHarness 3 record lead V4 or V5 dependent on position
   electrodes. Sampling frequency is 1000 Hz. The records were made on the
   basis of I.M.Sechenov University Clinical Hospital No.1, Russia. The
   monitor of physiological parameters and the device for daily monitoring
   of ECG was installed by the patient simultaneously. Recording was
   carried out for 24 hours simultaneously on both instruments. The device
   for daily monitoring of ECG is used to determine the sensitivity and
   specificity of the developed methods. MATLAB was used to implement
   algorithms. Results: Testing the algorithm with PhisioNet database
   resulted in a mean sensitivity of 99.21\% and a mean specificity of
   99.49\%. Testing the algorithm with Biomodule 3 resulted in a mean
   sensitivity of 99.02\% and a mean specificity of 93.69\%. 16 records
   were analyzed. The analyzer gave an incorrect result in 2 cases.
   Discussion: A careful study of records revealed that algorithm sets
   false tags in the absence of contact between the electrodes and the
   surface of the human body. The device for daily monitoring of ECG
   continues to operate normally at the same time. A careful study of the
   annotations PhysioNet showed that they contain errors. Some records have
   been shortened or excluded for this reason.
   Objectives: The aim of this paper is to improve the design of the
   current commercial cannula being used by clinicians in order to minimise
   the blood flow stasis and thus avoid thrombosis in ECMO drainage cannula
   Methods: A CFD simulation is used in order to determine the optimum
   desing for the drainage cannula. The improved cannula design was
   fabricated and validated in-vitro using particle image velocimetry.
   Results: 16 different cannula designs were simulated and results were
   analysed in terms of velocity and mass flow rate at side holes and
   different sections of the cannula. Different parameters including side
   holes diameter, number, spacing, distance to the cannula tip, and angle
   relative to flow direction were investigated. Simulation results were in
   agreement with PIV. Discussion: This study demonstrated that the
   improved drainage cannula can significantly reduce blood flow stasis,
   and potentially thrombosis, in patients receiving ECMO.
   Objectives: The aim of this work was to study the influence of the
   constructive and personal characteristics of the wireless energy
   transfer system on the temperature distribution in biological tissues.
   The basic parameters of the transcutaneous energy transfer system, such
   as transmitted power, efficiency and displacements, were taken into
   account. The patient's personal characteristics, such as the thickness
   of biological tissue layers, were also taken into account. To obtain
   data on the level of thermal damage, Henriques and Moritz study was
   used. Methods: The temperature data was obtained using the numerical
   solution of a bioheat equation by the finite element method. This
   article mathematically evaluates thermal injury based on Henriques and
   Moritz study, in which damage can be represented as the speed of a
   chemical process. Results: The temperature distributions in the tissues
   corresponding to the following types of displacements were obtained:
   axial, lateral, angular and also for the case where there are no
   displacements. Also the temperature distributions in tissues with
   different structures were obtained. Further, the temperature values at
   the maximum heating points were used to estimate thermal damage to the
   tissues. Discussion: It was established that when a wireless energy
   transfer system is operated without displacements, the severity of
   thermal injury does not exceed the threshold corresponding to a
   first-degree burn. It was also found that the patient's personal
   characteristics are influenced by the temperature distribution in the
   case when a change in the thickness of a layer of biological tissue
   occurs in the region of the nearest heat source.
   Objectives: The objective of this work is the development of a two-phase
   blood model fluid for the use in upscaled flow models. In large scaled
   models of different flow geometries, frequently used water-glycerol
   mixtures are not sufficient because in critical regions with small gaps,
   e.g. between the rotor and the wall in cardiac support systems, the
   two-phases of blood have a great influence on the flow. Therefore, it is
   necessary that the model fluid represents both phases of blood: the
   plasma and the cells. Methods: Transparent alginate beads were used as a
   model of red blood cells. A water-glycerol mixture was used as a model
   fluid for plasma. The alginate beads made up about 40 \% of the volume
   to model the proper hematocrit. Furthermore, the beads have a slightly
   higher density than the surrounding medium and keep floating once in
   motion. This was achieved by embedding hollow glass particles in the
   spheres that have a density <1.0 kg/l, also enabling particle tracking
   and flow analysis using the Particle Image Velocimetry method. A camera
   tracks the flow path of the beads through the required geometry.
   Reynolds similarity was maintained. Results: Flow analysis has been
   performed in an upscaled model of blade and gap of a ventricular assist
   device. Compared to a water-glycerol mixture, the proposed blood model
   fluid enabled the visualization of the strong influence of the two
   phases on the flow. Because of their transparency, it was possible to
   visualize the flow field at several layers in the fluid by choosing the
   appropriate light sections. Discussion: The proposed blood model fluid
   showed promising results in an initial case. Moreover, the results of
   the experiment lead to a possible optimization of the geometry of future
   rotor blades in blood pumps in order to reduce hemolysis. Further
   channel geometries will be explored. In the long term, the model can be
   used for experiments on flow analysis and optimization in blood pumps or
   as a validation model for CFD-codes to calculate multiphase flows.
   Objectives: FTR, the death rate among patients with complications, is an
   emerging quality metric, that has received an increasing focus in the
   last years. Concerning the management and outcome in life-threatening
   complications due to ECMO-insertion there are only few reports
   available. We report the successful rescue therapy in two patients of
   our hospitals large ECMO-patient cohort with severe ARDS who experienced
   right ventricular (RV)-perforation after v-v-ECMO-cannula insertion by
   the Seldinger's wire. Methods: RV perforation was assumed by
   deteriorating hemodynamics and immediate echo-cardiography showing
   cardiac tamponade during ECMO-cannula insertion. In cases of two
   patients an immediate bedside sternotomy was performed and the diagnosis
   verified. The source of bleeding was controlled and the tamponade was
   cleared. Either patient was transferred to the OR after ROSC for a
   definitive hemostasis and subsequent optimally controlled cannula
   placement. Results: Both patients survived this life-threatening event
   without neurological complications or further bleeding as well as no
   infections of the wounds. In Patient 1 the ECMO-therapy was not
   instituted immediately but later. This patient was weaned from ECMO
   after one week, survived six months but finally died due to an
   underlying disease. In Patient 2 switching the v-v- to an a-v-ECMO in
   the acute setting lead to a sufficient circulation during CPR. This
   patient was completely weaned from ECMO after 2 weeks and was finally
   discharged to rehabilitation after two months. Discussion: Successful
   management of seriously complicated ECMO- insertion is possible. The
   provision of an immediate bedside operative therapy and every kind of
   circulatory support to achieve ROSC seem to be essential in this
   setting. By reason of this concept a No-FTR situation could be achieved,
   which depicts a positive marker for quality of care for ECMO patients.
   Objectives: Blood trauma is an unintended consequence of mechanical
   circulatory support. Evidence indicates that exposure to high shears may
   induce sublethal changes to blood cells and also overt cell destruction.
   To determine whether such changes in blood properties have a functional
   impact on microcirculatory function, we examined the effect of surgery
   requiring cardiopulmonary bypass on the rheological properties of blood
   and also direct assessments of cell flux in the microcirculation.
   Methods: Thirty individuals requiring elective coronary artery bypass
   graft (n = 15) or valve surgery (n = 15) volunteered to participate.
   Dependent variables were collected prior to use of cardiopulmonary
   bypass, after 60 min of being on pump, and in the post-surgical period.
   Blood analyses included measurements of blood and plasma viscosity, red
   cell deformability, red cell aggregability, mechanical sensitivity of
   red cells, and levels of haemolysis, among others. Microcirculatory
   function was assessed using incident dark field visualisation of the
   sublingual vessels. Results and Discussion: Initial findings of this
   project indicate that blood viscosity and red cell aggregability are
   significantly affected by 60 min of cardiopulmonary bypass; these
   measures do not restore following the early post-surgical period.
   Microcirculatory assessments reveal altered transit and velocities of
   red cells, potentially indicating a link between biophysical assessments
   of blood and microcirculatory function. Extended presentation of this
   ongoing study will be presented, and discussed in the context of the
   secondary complications that still plague circulatory support patients.
   Objectives: Granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA), in which
   granulocytes and monocytes are removed from the patient's whole blood,
   is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The
   objective of the present study was to clarify the effects of the
   anticoagulation methods used on blood clot formation in the column
   during GMA. Methods: Extracorporeal circulation was established for 60
   minutes in male Sprague Dawley rats. A small column filled with 0.7 g of
   cellulose diacetate beads was used. We administered heparin at a total
   dose of 0.5 U/g by 2 different administration methods: the bolus
   administration method (single bolus administration prior to
   extracorporeal circulation) and the half bolus and half continuous
   administration method. During extracorporeal circulation the arterial
   pressure, column inlet pressure, venous pressure, and activated clotting
   time (ACT) were measured. The hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of the
   eluate of the residual clots was measured after the extracorporeal
   circulation. Results: Extracorporeal circulation was performed stably
   for 60 minutes without events like in-circuit coagulation, in both
   groups. The ACT reached its peak value within 30 minutes in the bolus
   administration group, to decline gradually thereafter; on the other
   hand, in the half bolus and half continuous administration group, the
   ACT remained nearly constant during the extracorporeal circulation. The
   Hb concentration in the eluate was significantly lower in the bolus
   administration group than in the half bolus and half continuous
   administration group. Discussion: The results indicated that even for
   the same total dose of heparin, clot formation in the column was
   influenced by the method of administration. We concluded that bolus
   administration of heparin, which led to early peaking of the ACT value
   was more effective to reduce residual blood clotting in the column as
   compared to half bolus and half continuous administration.
   Objectives: Suction at the inlet of a Left Ventricular Assist Device
   (LVAD) is common and known to cause adverse events. It occurs when
   tissue is drawn towards the cannula, thus leading to a reduced or even
   ceased flow. Moreover, the sudden occlusion can cause flow situations
   inside the device to be dramatically different from typical operation.
   The objectives were to quantify the effect of suction on the rotor
   bearing of an LVAD in an advanced development status and to mitigate
   unfavorable effects on the ongoing therapy and pump performance.
   Methods: A custom-made suction module was integrated into an
   established, active mock circulation loop upstream of an LVAD. This
   module comprises a membrane that can occlude the inflow cannula
   depending on the pressure in its fluid chamber relative to an adjustable
   air pressure chamber. The LVAD is equipped with rotor position sensors
   for online position tracking. Suction was initiated by reducing venous
   return and thus pump inlet pressure or by actively increasing air
   pressure in the respective chamber. The tests were performed with active
   and inactive suction speed control algorithms. Results: Spontaneous
   suction by reducing venous return was unlikely for the LVAD under test
   independently of the stationary air pressure applied. By actively
   provoking suction, increased radial force on the rotor was observed with
   uncharacteristic movement of the rotor. The radial gap remained
   satisfactory for all operational points and patient scenarios
   investigated. Suction was accurately detected by the controller and the
   speed reduced accordingly, thus leading to a relieve of the suction
   event. Discussion: Ventricular suction is a critical event in two ways
   as it negatively affects the LVAD therapy and secondly provokes
   uncharacteristic forces that might be critical for device performance.
   Future research is needed to ensure that experimental models of suction
   represent the variety of supported ventricles accurately.
   Objectives: Human amniotic membrane (AM) is employed in a broad field of
   applications as a wound dressing, corneal treatment, and scaffolding
   material. However, mechanical properties of native membranes vary
   depending on the zone of the placenta where the AM is obtained. For this
   reason, mimicking the AM through tissue engineering is a way to obtain a
   membrane with standardized properties. One technique to mimic the
   morphology of the extracellular matrix of AM is electrospinning. With
   electrospinning, a nanometric arranged similarly to the AM extracellular
   matrix made of different polymeric blends could be obtained. In
   addition, the correct storage is a key point in order to guarantee the
   availability of such tissue-engineered constructs for clinical
   applications. Methods: The AM extract is first prepared from native
   material and then freeze-dried. Afterwards, the AM-based scaffolds are
   obtained using blend electrospinning of polyethylene oxide and
   freeze-dried AM. Structural and compositional properties are assessed by
   scanning electron microscopy and confocal Raman spectroscopy. The
   mechanical properties are evaluated by static mechanical testing before
   and after cryopreservation. The scaffold is then seeded with multipotent
   stromal cells. The biocompatibility of the tissue-engineered AM is
   analyzed using cytotoxicity assay. Results: The tissue-engineered
   membrane presents a nanostructured morphology similar to the
   extracellular matrix of AM. The compositional results can detect the
   presence of collagen, fibronectin and hyaluronic acid in the final
   material. Preliminary results present changes in the mechanical
   properties related to the cryopreservation. The fabrication technique
   for the tissue-engineered AM seemed not to alter the biocompatibility
   with stem cells. Discussion: The AM is ideal for treatment of different
   tissues, and in combination with polymeric materials by electrospinning,
   it could be a suitable candidate for a tissue-engineered membrane with
   standardized properties.
   Objectives: A mixed flow blood pump with an outer casing diameter of 9
   mm is proposed as part of an intracorporeal membrane oxygenator. The
   usage of a blood pump deals with major challenges in the design of an
   intravenous device, specifically overcoming the pressure drop and
   enabling a controllable blood flow. This study presents the design,
   manufacturing, experimental and numerical investigation of the pump
   prototype. Methods: The pump prototype was manufactured using a Kudo3D
   Titan 1 (Kudo3D Inc. Dublin, USA) 3D printer, utilizing liquid photo
   polymeric resin coupled with a digital light processing (DLP) curing
   process. A static test loop consisting of the pump, ultrasonic flow
   sensor and pressure sensors was used to obtain the pump characteristics
   at different rotational speeds ranging from 23000 to 32000 rpm. A water
   glycerol mixture with a dynamic viscosity of 3.4 mPa.s was selected as
   working fluid. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were
   carried out using the open source CFD code OpenFOAM (R). Results: Over
   the investigated range from 30 to 500 mmHg, stable characteristic curves
   at different rotational speeds were measured. At 27700 rpm, a flow rate
   of 1.4 L/min against a pressure difference of 174 mmHg was observed. CFD
   simulations show a good agreement of the numerically predicted and
   measured pump characteristics, with an average deviation of about 8 \%.
   Discussion: The applied manufacturing process was capable to produce
   thin structured, complex parts down to 300 mu m wall thickness, durable
   enough to be used in experimental investigations up to 32000 rpm.
   Experimental pump characteristics show adequate performance of the
   proposed mixed flow pump for the intended purpose. CFD simulations
   accurately match the experimental pressure difference.
   Objectives: Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a technique to evaluate
   lungs before transplantation. As a tool for experimental research, this
   method allows organ modification and assessment. However, the costs are
   high. The aim of this study was to establish a low-cost EVLP model on
   the one hand and to investigate the feasibility of surgical graft
   downsizing during EVLP on the other hand. We compared a lobectomy, a
   stapled wedge and a sutured wedge resection during EVLP. Methods: Pigs
   of 60 kg weight were used for organ harvesting. After cardiac death
   lungs were retrieved, flushed with Perfadex and perfused with autologous
   blood for 4 hours of EVLP. The circuit was assembled from an ECMO system
   consisting of a Deltastream DP2 pump (Medos), an Affinity Fusion
   oxygenator (Medtronic) and a hardshell reservoir. After 90 minutes of
   perfusion a lobectomy was performed. At intervals of 30 minutes, a
   stapled wedge resection and a sutured wedge resection were performed.
   Air leak and the loss of blood were measured. The function of the lung
   was monitored including pulmonary artery pressure and blood gas
   analysis. Results: 20 porcine lungs were used to establish a stable
   model. Another 7 lungs underwent surgical interventions. The blood loss
   after lobectomy (3,14 +/- 4,14 ml/min) and after stapled wedge resection
   (5,29 +/- 8,1 ml/min) was lower than after sutured wedge resection (33
   +/- 17,36 ml/min). There was no major difference in air leak after the
   surgical interventions (lobectomy: 0,06 +/- 0,16 l/min vs. stapler: 0,03
   +/- 0,09 l/min vs. suture: 0,04 +/- 0,1 l/min). The oxygenation
   performance was satisfactory. The pulmonary artery pressure was in a
   physiological range. Bleeding into the parenchyma after suture was
   higher compared to the other interventions. Discussion: The low-cost
   custom-made EVLP model presented here is feasible and stable. Surgical
   interventions during EVLP are possible. Performing a lobectomy and a
   wedge resection is superior to a wedge resection with suture regarding
   to the blood loss.
   Objectives: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) possess an
   exceptional differentiation potential, as they are able to differentiate
   towards cells from all three germ layers. Owing to this capability, they
   are an attractive cell source for regenerative medicine applications and
   in vitro disease models. To date, coated substrates with Matrigel (R)
   and Geltrex (TM) have been providing promising platforms for hiPSC
   culture and differentiation. Besides many advantages, both substrates
   provide some drawbacks such as batch-to-batch variation and xenogeneic
   origin, which pose problems in potential clinical applications. To
   tackle these issues, a matrigel-mimetic synthetic biomaterial able to
   maintain hiPSCs in culture is required. Cell behavior is controlled by a
   complex set of biophysical (e.g. stiffness) as well as biological (e.g.
   growth factors) parameters. In this study, we want to develop a fully
   synthetic hiPSC-supporting hydrogel that allows investigating the
   influence of biophysical and biological parameters on hiPSCs. Methods:
   The substrates were prepared via crosslinking starPEG and heparin
   molecules with different molar ratios. Substrates were biofunctionalized
   with two methods based on NHS ester binding to amine groups of laminins
   in different ratios. hiPSCs were seeded on substrates and the medium was
   changed every day. Cells were stained after 72 hours for pluripotency
   markers (OCT4-SSEA4). Results: Functionalized substrates with storage
   modulus of 4kPa maintained hiPSCs culture. On the other hand, no
   adherent cells were observed on the substrates with a storage modulus of
   1kPa and 10kPa. Discussion: StarPEG-heparin hydrogels functionalized
   with laminin mixtures clearly represented an appropriate
   matrigel-mimetic growth substrate for the hiPSC culture and maintenance
   of their pluripotency. 3D cultures have already been shown to be
   superior to 2D and it is an outlook of this work.
   Objectives: Radiological procedures utilizing intravascular iodinated
   contrast media are being widely applied for both diagnostic and
   therapeutic purposes and represent one of the main causes of
   contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).In this hospital-based study we tried
   to assess predictors for the development of CIN in patients undergoing
   cardiac catheterization. Methods: A total of 5604 patients undergoing
   coronary angiogram/PCI from 2007-2017 were enrolled in the study.
   Multivariate predictors of CIN were identified by logistic regression
   using stepwise selection with entry and exit criteria of p < 0.1. A
   two-sided 95\% confidence interval (CI) was constructed around the point
   estimate of the odds (OR). A p value Results: CIN occurred in 6 (1 parts
   per thousand) patients. The mean age of patients suffering from CIN was
   higher than in the whole population (66.5 +/- 31.15 vs. 58.66 +/- 28.57,
   p=0.03). Characteristics of patients who developed CIN were: older age,
   diabetes, higher creatinine and lower EF. The incidence of CIN in
   patients with diabetes was higher and statistically significant (84\%
   vs. 16\%, p=0.01). Emergency cases were at higher risk of developing CIN
   than elective patients (85\% vs.15\%, p=0.001), respectively. Diabetes,
   CKD and EF < 50\% were independent predictors of CIN (RR 2.4, 95\% CI:
   1.88 - 7.132, p=0.008; RR 3.1, 95\% CI: 2.17 - 6.682, p=0.003; RR 1.6,
   95\% CI: 2.88 - 7.132, p=0.01, respectively). Discussion: The
   development of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients who underwent
   angiography and PCI was mainly related to older age, diabetes, lower GFR
   and heart failure, but not contrast material exposure.
   Objectives: To examine the efficacy of the short-time total liquid
   ventilation (TLV) with oxygen micro/nano bubble dispersed saline for
   severe and lethal respiratory failure (experiment 1 and 2, respectively)
   induced by intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
   Methods: In experiment 1, fifteen rats were divided into three groups:
   LPS+TLV group (treatment group) received 5-min TLV 20 min after LPS (5
   mg/kg) administration, LPS+MGV group received 5-min mechanical gas
   ventilation (MGV) after the LPS administration, and PBS+MGV group
   received 5-min MGV 20 min after administration of phosphate buffered
   saline (PBS) instead of LPS. Ventilation weaning was performed after
   respiratory management for three hours. At two days after each
   treatment, hemodynamics and blood gas parameters were measured and the
   rats were subsequently sacrificed. The excised lungs were used for
   histological analysis and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In experiment 2,
   ten rats were divided into two groups: LPS+TLV group and LPS+MGV group.
   Ten mg/kg LPS was used for inducing lethal acute lung injury and the
   survival rate was used for the primary outcome. Results: In experiment
   1, significant differences were confirmed between LPS+TLV group and
   LPS+MGV group in the value of blood oxygen, weight loss ratio, and
   inflammatory cytokines levels in BAL-fluid (p < 0.05). On the other
   hand, there was a significant difference only in arterial oxygen
   pressure between LPS+TLV group and PBS+MGV group. Severe inflammation in
   LPS+MGV group was also confirmed in the histological analysis. In
   experiment 2, all rats in LPS+MGV group died within two days, whereas
   80\% of the rats in LPS+TLV group survived for one week. Moreover, the
   conditions of the survival rats showed normal in the pulmonary function
   and the alveolar structure after one week. Discussion: It is indicated
   that 5-min TLV with oxygen micro/nano bubble dispersed saline after LPS
   administration prevented severe respiratory failure and improved the
   survival rate dramatically without any disorders.
   Objectives: Natural biological tissues have electrical conductivities
   and it is required that artificial tissues also possessed such a
   property. We investigated the specific conductivity (s) of the
   bionanomaterial in the composition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). Methods: We investigated the
   specific conductivity (s) of the bionanomaterial in the composition of
   bovine serum albumin (BSA) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT).
   The aqueous dispersion contained 25 wt.\% BSA, 0.45 wt.\% SWCNT.
   Dispersion on silicon substrates was applied by screen printing. After
   drying, the formed layers had approximate sizes: area - 5'20 mm2,
   thickness - 5 15mm. For all samples the dependence of s on temperature t
   was recorded when they were in a thermostat. The s(t) curves were taken
   with a numerous cycle n = 1 5 with increasing and decreasing
   temperatures in the region of t 20 45 degrees C. Results: The following
   data was obtained. With increasing n, the values of s and the hysteresis
   on s(t) decreased: at n = 1 - s 0.11 S/m, temperature resistance
   coefficient a -0.004 K-1, hysteresis on s(t), i.e. R/R0 0.90, where R0
   is the initial resistance, R is the final resistance; at n = 5 - s 36
   S/m, a -0.002 K-1, R/R0 0.95. Spectral studies in the optical range did
   not reveal any changes in the sample before and after a cyclic thermal
   action, which underlines the stability of BSA. Thus, in the layers of
   the BSA/SWCNT the s increases and the hysteresis on s(t) decreases with
   n = 1 5. Apparently, this behavior is associated with an increase in the
   number of contacts between nanotubes in the albumin matrix. Discussion:
   The studied layers of the composite bionanomaterial (BSA/SWCNT) has an
   acceptable value of specific conductivity (1,10 S/m) and mechanical
   properties (hardness 300 MPa) and is promising for biomedical
   applications.
   Objectives: Determine the outcomes and survival of patients who receive
   a temporary total artificial heart (TAH) as bridge to transplant or as
   bridge to decision by evaluating data from the Interagency Registry for
   Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) database in the
   U.S. Methods: Review of the INTERMACS database between 2006 and April
   2017 revealed a total of 450 patients had been implanted. The data was
   reviewed to determine survival rates, adverse events, and competing
   outcomes. Risk factors for mortality were determined using hazard
   function analysis. Results: Data from 450 patients (87\% men; mean age,
   50 years) were available in the INTERMACS database. The 2 most common
   diagnoses were dilated cardiomyopathy (50\%) and ischemic cardiomyopathy
   (20\%). Risk factors for right heart failure were present in 82\% of
   patients. Most patients were INTERMACS Profile 1 (43\%) or 2 (37\%) at
   implantation. There were 266 patients who eventually underwent
   transplantation, and 162 died. Overall 3-, 6-, and 12-month actuarial
   survival rates were 73\%, 62\%, and 53\%, respectively. Risk factors for
   death included older age (p = 0.001), need for pre-implantation dialysis
   (p = 0.006), higher creatinine (p = 0.008) and lower albumin (p < 0.001)
   levels, and implantation at a low-volume center (<= 10 TAHs; p < 0.001).
   Competing-outcomes analysis showed 71\% of patients in high-volume
   centers were alive on the device or had undergone transplantation at 12
   months after TAH implantation vs 57\% in low-volume centers (p = 0.003).
   Discussion: Patients receiving TAHs have rapidly declining cardiac
   function and require prompt intervention. Experienced centers have
   better outcomes, likely related to patient selection, timing of
   implantation, patient care, and device management. Organized transfer of
   knowledge to low-volume centers could improve outcomes
   Objectives: To analyze the hemodynamic effect of ventricular assist
   devices using a multi-scale mathematical model of the human
   extracellular fluid system. Methods: A Ventricular Assist Device (VAD)
   model has been incorporated into the Digital Avatar, a multi-scale,
   closed-loop mathematical model of the human fluid system is composed of
   a network of major arteries, major veins, and lumped parameter models
   for the heart, pulmonary circulation, arterioles, capillaries, venules,
   cerebrospinal fluid and brain interstitial fluid. The mathematical model
   relies on one-dimensional PDEs for blood vessels and on ODEs for lumped
   parameter models. Results: Based on the model, we have quantified the
   hemodynamics of the systemic circulation with and without the medical
   device in healthy and unhealthy scenarios. Results will be shown at the
   conference. Discussion: Traditionally, bench testing, animal studies and
   clinical trials are used as the main source of evidence for getting
   medical devices on the market in the US. The associated costs and time
   are enormous and represent a burden for MedTech companies. In addition,
   the FDA wants to minimize animal and human study testing. In recent
   years, Computational Modelling and Simulation (CM\&S) has made huge
   steps forward. CM\&S are a valuable regulatory tool for its significant
   cost-savings in evaluating medical devices, simulating performance under
   scenarios that may not be possible with human use and quantifying the
   safety and efficacy of medical devices. However, the existing CM\&S
   tools are highly specialized for each field and do not provide a
   platform that integrates all human body mechanisms. Computational Life's
   vision is to replicate all body mechanisms into a single, integrated
   software called Digital Avatar platform. The Digital Avatar platform
   will enable MedTech companies to perform feasibility testing and
   quantify the safety and the efficacy of (ideally) any type of medical
   device. Here we will show an application with the VAD system.
   Objectives: Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro cultivation systems have
   gained increased attention, since using these systems allows the precise
   study of mammalian cell physiology, intercellular interaction, as well
   as cell-matrix interactions. Another important cell culture parameter,
   often neglected in traditional cultivation, is the concentration of
   dissolved oxygen. Generally, cell culture is performed under ambient
   oxygen saturation (21\%), while the oxygen amount available in vivo in
   human tissue is much lower (1\% to 15\%). The stiffness of in vivo
   tissues and in vitro constructs also plays a crucial role in cell fate
   and physiology. Methods: Semi-synthetic hydrogels with tunable
   properties allow creating a wide range of in vitro material stiffness.
   The development of hydrogel-based 3D cell culture gradient systems
   enables to obtain complex, but precisely defined in vitro
   microenvironments, which in turn allow a systematic investigation of the
   influence of microenvironmental conditions. Oxygen gradients in 3D and
   2D cell culture can be created with the help of incubation chambers.
   Results: Encapsulation of mesenchymal stem cells containing fluorescent
   hypoxia sensors reveals specific conditions where the hypoxic response
   is activated and determines the influence of hydrogel stiffness on the
   hypoxic response. In the presented study, exact correlations between in
   situ O2 concentrations in 3D cell cultures (hydrogels and microtissues)
   and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) activation are disclosed for the
   first time. Discussion: Creating stable in vitro oxygen gradients in 3D
   hydrogel-based cultures with stiffness variety helps to better
   understand and predict cell behavior (survival, cytokine expression,
   spontaneous differentiation of stem cells or migration capacity) in
   physiological and pathological in vivo conditions, as well as to find
   optimal conditions to simulate the in vivo cell niche.
   Objectives: Most breast and prostate cancers metastasize to the bone. To
   establish macrometastases, the disseminated tumor cells (DTC) need to
   have stem cell-like properties such as self-renewal and differentiation
   into other tumor cells. They compete with hematopoietic stem and
   progenitor cells (HSPC) and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) for
   their specific microenvironment or `niches'. Apart from biochemical
   factors in niches, biophysical cues also influence such interactions.
   The aim of this project is to investigate the intercellular crosstalk
   that occurs among these cells and the signalling pathways in a 3D porous
   hydrogel that was previously established in our group. Methods: The
   hydrogel mimics in structure the trabecular region of the bone marrow.
   Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions will be investigated using
   fluorescence imaging techniques. The pathways will be analyzed with the
   help of Western blots and specific inhibitors. Cytokine array and ELISA
   will be used for assessing auto- and paracrine communication via soluble
   factors. The biophysical parameters such as the 3D architecture and
   mechanical properties will also be tuned and their effect studied.
   Results: The coculture of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with
   bone marrow-derived MSCs and the leukemic cell line KG-1a reveal
   formation of spheroid-like structures in the gels. Experiments are being
   performed to study the cell-cell interactions within these structures.
   Parallel experiments are being carried out regarding the effect of the
   3D architecture, which will be introduced by varying the porosity of the
   gel. Discussion: The results of these studies will help us to develop in
   vitro models of different tumor cell niches that will allow us in
   gaining a fundamental insight into the early events of bone metastasis.
   Tuning these parameters in the 3D bone marrow analog, we can have an
   understanding about how the biophysical cues affect the cellular
   activities.
   Objectives: Bioartificial liver devices aim to replace the
   detoxification and metabolic functions of the liver in people with liver
   failure. Shear stress and local velocities created by flow inside porous
   scaffolds need to be optimised to improve cell viability and avoid
   inflammation, however there are no relevant studies on the topic to
   date. Here, fluid dynamics inside porous cryogels were characterised
   using a purpose-built micro-PIV system. The aims were to develop a
   micro-PIV setup to record the flow inside cryogel structure and to
   characterise the nature of flow inside the cryogel channels by video
   post-processing in order to determine inlet design. Methods: HEMA- based
   cryogels were synthesised by cryogelation technique and the
   microstructure was analysed by SEM, confocal microscope and mu CT. Open
   porosity, overall porosity and permeability were extrapolated from mu
   CT. A mu PIV set up was developed to visualise flow inside cryogels
   which was composed of a digital camera with a long-distance microscope
   objective, a pulsating LED light source, a pump and an optical chamber
   to host the cryogel. Glass beads of 10 mu m size were used as tracers to
   mimic red blood cells. Videos were analysed with PIVlab in Matlab which
   allowed the interpolation of local velocities. Results: Cryogels
   possessed an open porosity, with pore size up to 100 mu m, as well as an
   interconnected network of pores, making it suitable for a perfused
   system. Fluid dynamics were optimized using a mu PIV setup which allows
   for the visualisation of flow inside the cryogel channels. Discussion:
   Videos showed that internal flow did not reorganize itself through the
   channels and was found to be laminar with Re < 1 with low vorticity.
   This suggests that molecules and toxins of the blood in the centre of a
   channel would not interact with hepatocytes seeded on the cryogel pore
   walls. Hence, flow reorganization could be promoted through a layered
   bioreactor. A layered cryogel structure was introduced to improve flow
   characteristics and improve toxin/hepatocyte interaction.
   Objectives: Generation of a large-scale stem cell derived bioartificial
   cardiac tissue (BCT) as a potential therapeutic option to replace
   damaged myocardium after myocardial infarction. Methods: Large-scale BCT
   was generated from cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human induced
   pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) mixed with human fibroblasts and a
   hydrogel solution in a newly designed tissue chamber with a diameter of
   43 mm. The BCT development was microscopically recorded and evaluated.
   Maturation of CMs within the tissue was confirmed by immunofluorescence
   staining for cardiac markers (alpha-SA, cTnT) as well as cell junction
   proteins (Con. 43, N-Cad). The integration of the tissue chamber in the
   novel custom-made bioreactor allowed investigating the initial
   parameters for electromechanical stimulation (such as pressure, stress
   amplitude, frequency) necessary for proper tissue maturation in a more
   physiological manner. To investigate the calcium handling through the
   tissue a new transgenic hiPSC line containing a genetically encoded
   calcium indicator (GCaMP6f) has been developed. Results: Microscopically
   evaluation at different time points reveals a progressive reduction of
   nearly 27\% of the initial volume after 15 days, ccorresponding with an
   increased intercellular connectivity. After 48h, the tissue exhibited
   spontaneous contractions and coordinated and rhythmic contraction within
   the whole tissue after 6 days. As preliminary analysis, the beating of
   the tissue was video-optically recorded showing an estimated beating
   rate of 102 beats per minute. Immunofluorescence staining performed at
   day 15 showed highly organised cross-striations of sarcomere proteins.
   Initial integration of the tissue chamber in the bioreactor and
   implementation of the new GCaMP6f reporter cell line is still on-going.
   Discussion: The initial results confirmed that is possible to generate a
   large-scale BCT. However, the properties of the tissue have to be
   further investigated.
   Objectives: The Fontan procedure is performed for univentricular
   correction of the heart in pediatric patients with tricuspid atresia. In
   the Fontan circulation, the veins connect directly to the pulmonary
   artery. However, as a result of the procedure the load on the single
   functional ventricle of the heart and veins increases. Eventually,
   patients need a heart transplantation. A possible solution to the
   circulation deficiencies of the Fontan patients could be the ventricular
   assist device (VAD). The VAD is implanted between veins and the
   pulmonary artery. The aim of this study is to develop a model of the
   Fontan circulation with VAD support. Methods: We use mathematical models
   to reduce the time and resources spent on in vivo research. Nonlinear
   mathematical models represent sections of the cardiovascular system
   (CVS) in the form of blocks. Pressure variations in the CVS sections are
   described by a system of differential equations. Results: Appling VAD to
   the Fontan patients exhibits the potential to increase the venous return
   of blood. According to the Frank-Starling law, the stroke volume
   increases with increasing venous return. VAD creates a necessary
   pressure differential between the venous and pulmonary sections of CVS.
   Discussion: The interaction model of the Fontan circulation with VAD
   support demonstrates the normalization of the pressure and volume
   distribution in the CVS. This indicates that the method studied in this
   work may be a way to optimize the health condition of patients after
   Fontan procedure.
   Objectives: Autologous pericardium is one of the most ideal materials
   for cardiovascular reconstruction including pulmonary arteries and
   valvular cusps especially in pediatric patients. To improve the surgical
   handling, chemical pretreatments such as dehydration by ethanol (ET) or
   crosslinking by glutaraldehyde (GA) have been commonly attempted. In
   this study, we compared the effects of such chemical treatments with
   short period (10 min) on the mechanical properties of the porcine
   pericardium. Methods: Porcine pericardium (n=3) was separated into 3
   groups, raw group with no treatments (RAW), that under dehydration with
   70\% ET for10 min (ET) and crosslinking with 0.6\% GA for 10 min (GA).
   We measured 5 parameters of mechanical properties: the burst pressure,
   suture retention strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), ultimate
   strain (\%) and stimulus modulus. Results: Minimal burst pressure of RAW
   group, ET group and GA group were 12160 mmHg, 10640 mmHg, and 8360 mmHg,
   respectively, all of which were high enough for cardiovascular
   substitutes. There were no significant differences in suture retention
   strength (RAW: 3.242 +/- 0.261 N, ET: 3.298 +/- 0.214 N, GA: 2.985 +/-
   0.165 N, p=0.529), UTS (RAW: 18.238 +/- 1.987 MPa, ET: 19.104 +/- 2.234
   MPa, GA: 16.059 +/- 1.233 MPa, p=0.486) or Young's modulus (RAW: 4.964
   +/- 0.551 MPa, ET: 4.544 +/- 0.719 MPa, GA: 3.921 +/- 0.288 MPa,
   p=0.408). Only the ultimate strain of GA group was significantly higher
   between the 3 groups (RAW: 35.64 +/- 2.82 \%, ET: 37.99 +/- 2.38 \%, GA:
   46.39 +/- 3.96 \%, p=0.046). Discussion: Short period of chemical
   treatment using ET and GA might make it possible to improve the surgical
   handling without deteriorating the mechanical properties of pericardium.
   Engineering modelling and simulation have been being used in different
   industries for better product and process development for already many
   decades. Together with the developments in medical imaging, this
   engineering approach can now be applied to understand how different
   human organs function and eventually develop devices to replace them or
   support their correct functioning. A digital environment for development
   of artificial organs and medical devices is possible with correct
   application of engineering modelling and simulation. These concepts
   enable researchers and engineers to perform design iterations rapidly
   and with ease. This is why the application of engineering modelling and
   simulation is considered as one of the very important bio-technological
   advancements in the recent years and is projected to be so in the close
   future. In this respect; cardiology is one of the areas where this
   potential is being converted to valuable outputs. Virtual modelling and
   analysis of a representative beating human heart, patient specific heart
   modelling or digital prototypes of heart devices are main research
   interests of an interdisciplinary community of cardiologists, surgeons,
   engineers, and physicians. In the scope of cardiovascular simulations;
   patient specific (or normalized among a group of patients) medical
   imaging based CFD simulations and coupled multiphysics FSI simulations
   are the main approaches for generating the simulation frameworks moving
   forward in the road to ultimate digital twins of the human heart. This
   presentation is intended to give insights about various processes that
   lead to higher fidelity digital representations in the scope of
   cardiovascular simulations, including below:
   - CFD model generation based on CT scans - Non-invasive digital
   angiography \& FFR CT (Fractional Flow Reserve) - Post-TAVI coronary
   flow - Blood flow in SIMULIA LHHM (Living Heart Human Model) with
   mechanical valves - Transcatheter tissue engineered aortic valve FSI
   simulation - Evolut R stent deployment in LHHM - Mitral Valve and Mitral
   Clip FSI simulation The presentation intends to give a brief
   introduction on the simulation concepts/approaches which can be applied
   to cardiovascular problems. While it intends to encourage the community
   to take the advantage of these concepts in cardiovascular research, it
   highlights the importance of correct modelling and accurate numerical
   simulations.
   Objectives: The Berlin Heart EXCOR is the most commonly used ventricular
   assist device in children. Pump thrombosis is a major complication of
   the system and is most likely to occur in smaller pumps used for
   children under the age of 2. Pump exchange is seen as the therapeutic
   gold standard, but is associated with high mortality if in- or outflow
   cannulas are affected and therefor have to be changed surgically.
   Methods: Herein we report our experience in the use of tissue-type
   plasminogen activator (Alteplase, Actilyse (R)) for the therapy of an
   acute pump thrombosis subtotally occluding the inflow cannula of a 7
   month old girl supported by a Berlin Heart EXCOR LVAD. The infant was
   supported by LVAD therapy used for acute left ventricular failure due to
   fulminant myocarditis, and the system was implanted 20 days prior to
   when the thrombotic event was reported. A treatment protocol of 1.2mg/kg
   - initial bolus application of 0.12mg/kg/2mins - of Alteplase infusion
   given continuously for 120mins was used, and the assist device was
   connected to a Maquet Quadrox-I neonatal and pediatric oxygenator to
   obviate thrombembolic complications. Results: The infant supported by
   Berlin Heart EXCOR LVAD was haemodynamically stable prior to the
   thrombotic event, and anticoagulation was performed with a continuous
   heparin infusion. Within a couple of hours, she became tachycardic and
   developed signs of low cardiac output, and a subtotal occlusion of the
   inflow cannula of the Berlin Heart System was diagnosed. As surgery was
   felt to be highly problematic, we decided to infuse Alteplase and
   achieved short-term success with resolution of the pump thrombosis
   within 2 hours. There was no adverse event. Discussion: Tissue-type
   plasminogen activator thrombolysis might be an effective treatment for
   Berlin Heart EXCOR thrombosis in haemodynamically compromised children.
   Additionally, the use of a Maquet Quadrox-I oxygenator might minimize
   the risk of major complications (i.e. thromboembolism) that have been
   reported in the literature.
   Drug discovery and development to date has relied on animal models,
   which are useful, but fail to resemble human physiology. The discovery
   of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) has led to the emergence
   of a new paradigm of drug screening using human patient- and
   disease-specific organ/tissue-models. One promising approach to generate
   these models is by combining the hiPSC technology with microfluidic
   devices tailored to create microphysiological environments. Such
   organ-on-a-chip platforms (OoCs) or microphysiological systems combine
   human genetic background, in vivo-like tissue structure, physiological
   functionality, and ``vasculature-like{''} perfusion. Using
   microfabrication techniques, we have developed a variety of OoCs that
   incorporate complex human 3D tissues, such as retinal, choroidal,
   cardiac, pancreatic, and adipose tissue. By generating
   microphysiological environments the platform is capable of keeping the
   tissues viable and functional over multiple weeks. The OoCs generally
   consist of three functional components: organ-specific tissue chambers
   mimicking in vivo structure and microenvironment of the respective
   tissues; ``vasculature-like{''} media channels enabling a precise and
   computationally predictable delivery of soluble compounds (nutrients,
   drugs, hormones); ``endothelial-like{''} barriers protecting the tissues
   from shear forces while allowing diffusive transport. The small scale
   and accessibility for in situ analysis makes our OoCs amenable for both
   massive parallelization and integration into a high-content-screening
   approach. To facilitate and enable the adoption of OoCs in industrial
   and non-specialized laboratories, we have developed technologies for
   automated 3D tissue generation and for the flexible plug\&play
   connection of individual modules to multi-organ-chips. These
   technologies paired with the versatility of our OoCs pave the way for
   applications in drug development, personalized medicine, toxicity
   screening, and mechanistic research.
   Objectives: The HeartMate 3 (HM3; Abbott, USA) is a new compact LVAD
   which is associated with several new technical features (e.g. fully
   magnetically levitated pump, artificial pulse, large pump gaps, modular
   driveline, etc.). These benefits are supposed to lead to superior
   outcomes and reduced adverse events as compared to its predecessor
   HeartMate II (HMII; Abbott, USA) and other comparable assist devices.
   With this study, we investigated the effect of HM3 implantation on the
   occurrence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleedings compared to other LVADs.
   Methods: We retrospectively studied a patient cohort of 595 patients who
   were supported with left ventricular assist devices. 170 Patients were
   supported by HMII, 81 Patients were supported by HM3 and 344 Patients
   were supported by HVAD (HeartWare, Medtronic, USA). Data was determined
   through retrospective examination of medical records. Exclusion criteria
   were biventricular assist devices and other types of assist devices as
   well as LVAD exchange and re-operative procedures. Results: Out of 595
   patients 146 patients (24.4\%) presented with gastrointestinal bleeding
   after LVAD implantation. In the multivariate analysis GI bleeding was
   significantly dependent on age but not on the BMI or gender of the
   patient. Statistically we were able to show that the occurrence of GI
   bleedings is significantly connected to general bleedings but not to
   cerebral hemorrhages. The subgroup analysis revealed that the occurrence
   of GI bleedings was higher in the HVAD (26\%) and HMII (26\%) groups
   compared to the HM3 patients (14\%). However, statistical significance
   could not be achieved. Discussion: The novel HeartMate 3 shows a
   promising adverse event profile with a reduced rate of gastrointestinal
   bleedings compared to its competitors. However statistical significance
   could not be achieved in this study. Thus, larger multi-center cohort
   analyses are needed.
   Objectives: In medical practice, it is necessary to control the
   movements of various parts of the body: limbs, joints, chest, tumors,
   etc. For such purposes, the most suitable are the composite
   bionanomaterials in the composition of carbon nanotubes. We investigated
   the strain sensor (tensoresistor) based on the layers of the
   bionanomaterial contained biological material (bovine serum albumin, BSA
   - matrix) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT - filler). Methods:
   The aqueous dispersion of 25 wt.\% BSA/0.3 wt.\% MWCNT was applied by
   screen printing on flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrates. After
   drying layers by laser irradiation ( 970 nm) various parameters of
   layers were controlled, i.e. resistance R, bending angle q, number of
   cycles n, measurement time, etc. One measurement cycle corresponded to a
   change within the range q >>+/- 150 degrees. Results: The slopes of Sq =
   (1/R0)dR/dq of the R(q) curves were considered to be
   strain-sensitivities, where R0 is the resistance of the sensor with q=0.
   It was found that with increasing the number n, R and Sq increase and
   the hysteresis on R(q) decreases. For the tensoresistor obtained:
   specific resistances 0.1 divided by 1 Wxm, Sq1.0 divided by 1.5\%/grad.
   These results are high. Discussion: The physical picture of the change
   in the R(q) is as follows. When q>0, compression occurs, the amount of
   contacts between the nanotubes increases and the resistance drops
   relative to the state q=0. When q<0, the nanotubes move away from each
   other, the amount of contacts between the nanotubes decreases and the
   resistance increases relative to the state q=0. The examined layers of
   the bionanomaterial BSA/MWCNT as a strain sensor is of a particular
   interest for medical practice. In particular, for monitoring: movements
   (arms, blinking) and detection of signs of pathology (respiratory
   diseases, angina, et. al.).
   The new European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) is applicable on 26th
   May 2020. Then the current Medical Device Directive(MDD) and its
   national transpositions like the current German Medical Device Act
   (Medizinproduktegesetz) will be replaced by the new rules. Further
   transitions periods for existing certificates will not help for devices
   of the lowest risk class and will not free parties from taking into
   consideration the new rules for handling of device problems or
   registration. The new certification of existing devices in time will be
   challenging, because the accreditation and notification of notified
   bodies in accordance with the new requirements, which are needed for
   certification of higher risk class medical devices, is ongoing very
   slowly. The new European database is still not gone live, but the device
   and economic operator registration is dependent on the functioning of
   that database. A strong focus of the new regulation is on clinical
   evaluation of medical devices, which will leave manufacturers and
   developers probably with open questions. For example, what extend of
   clinical data is sufficient for keeping an existing device on the
   market? The presentation will highlight several obvious or less obvious
   changes due to the new regulation. It will provide guidance where to
   find additional answers for specific questions. And it will give an
   outlook on upcoming additional legislation and guidance.
   Objectives: Exercise capacity in patients with a continuous-flow left
   ventricular assist device (LVAD) is 50\% compared to healthy subjects.
   Some patients show a better performance than others. Aim of this work is
   to investigate the factors responsible of this inter-subject
   variability. Methods: A cardiorespiratory simulator (CRS) was developed
   and combined with a model of the HVAD running at 2700 rpm to reproduce
   an ``average{''} LVAD patients hemodynamic at rest and at exercise. The
   CRS was validated using the average hemodynamic data of >200 LVAD
   patients from the literature. Starting from this ``average{''} LVAD
   profile, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by simulating a left/right
   ventricular contractility (Elmax/Ermax) and heat rate (HR) 20\% higher
   than value usually observed at exercise. Results: The simulated
   ``average{''} LVAD profile at rest is in full support with a total
   cardiac output (CO) of 4.8 l/min and a wedge pressure (Pw) of 13 mmHg.
   At exercise Pw increases to 26 mmHg and CO increases to 6.8 l/min, of
   which 5.3 l/min pumped by the LVAD (QLVAD) and 1.5 l/min by the
   ventricle (QLV). An increased Elmax at exercise assures lower Pw (22
   mmHg) and higher CO (7.4 l/min) due to a better contribution of the
   ventricle (QVAD=4.7 l/min, QLV=2.7 l/min). An improved HR also helps to
   sustain a better CO (7.1 l/min) as a combined effect of both pumps
   (QVAD= 5.4 l/min, QLV=1.7 l/min). A better Emaxr induces a smaller
   improvement in CO (7.0 l/min) due to the increased LVAD support
   (QVAD=5.5 l/min, QLV=1.5 l/min), however Pw reaches 31 mmHg. Discussion:
   A better left ventricular inotropic response is mostly effective in
   accommodating a higher CO at exercise. A better right ventricular
   function has mild effects on CO and can increase Pw if not sustained by
   a good ejection on the left side. These results should be taken into
   account for the design of a physiological LVAD speed controller,
   tailored on specific patient's needs.
   The electro-hydraulically actuated Carmat total artificial heart (C-TAH)
   is designed for biventricular replacement in patients suffering from
   end-stage heart failure, either as bridge to transplant or destination
   therapy. It generates pulsatile flow which is automatically adapted to
   the patient's physiological needs. The device contains bio-prosthetic
   blood contacting materials, allowing for low dose anti-coagulation. A
   multi-centre European study is currently underway to assess the safety
   and performance of the C-TAH, with 6-months survival as primary
   objective. Preliminary results will be presented from a cohort of 10
   patients included in the study.
   Objectives: The mechano-biological behavior of mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs) in 2D and 3D cultures is determined by formation of actin
   filaments which occur as branched stress fibers. For clinical-scale
   expansion of functional MSCs, the use of xeno-based serum products is
   prohibited, but human platelet lysate (HPL) can potentially replace
   fetal bovine serum. Here we investigate actin filament formation and
   mitochondrial morphology in the 2D and 3D MSC culture supplemented with
   HPL and analyzed immunomodulatory molecules GARP, Foxp3 and IDO
   following pro-inflammatory stimulation. Methods: Human platelet lysate
   composition was determined with a proteome profiler assay. Amnion
   derived MSCs were cultured in HPL supplemented media and MSC morphology
   was analyzed by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy. Mechano-biological properties of cultured MSCs were
   performed by atomic force microscopy. Results: The occurrence of actin
   filaments in 2D MSCs cultivated in HPL supplemented media was decreased
   as compared to conventional growth media, where the number of ventral
   stress fibers, anchored at each end by focal adhesions, was affected and
   influenced membrane elasticity. Dorsal stress fibers or transverse arcs
   were not affected. Mitochondrial network dynamics in HPL cultivated MSCs
   showed a perinuclear accumulation. 3D cultivation of MSCs was less
   sensitive to media supplementation. Functional activity of GARP was
   found non-stimulated MSCs while expression of Foxp3 and IDO relied on
   pro-inflammatory stimuli. Discussion: In conclusion we can say that
   mechano-biological capabilities of MSCs cultivated in 2D and 3D rely on
   stress fibers, mitochondrial distribution and certain bioactive
   molecules such as GARP, Foxp3 and IDO. HPL supplementation leads to
   downregulation of f-actin filament formation as well as conserved
   membrane elasticity.
   Objectives: Modern research in cryobiology requires a deeper
   understanding of the influence of different factors on the
   cryopreservation of cells, tissues, and organs. One of these factors is
   ice crystallization which has a tremendous impact on the surveillance
   and quality of live objects during freezing, long term storage, and
   thawing. Analysis of this process requires software which should be able
   to obtain quantitative parameters of crystals in a human-like manner
   with acceptable processing speed. The purpose of this work is to
   consider the possibility of using the multiscale image representation
   for the quantitative analysis of ice crystals. Methods: In our research,
   we used microscopic images of ice crystals during crystals formation and
   thawing. In previous studies for the segmentation of ice crystals on the
   image, we used different approaches such as active contour. At the same
   time, it should be noticed that the speed of active contour expansion is
   low and thus time-consuming to process large time sequence. Thus, we
   suggest the application of a Gaussian Pyramid. This multiscale
   representation allows analysis at a low scale and improves at a high
   scale. Results: We have analyzed multiple images using the proposed
   approach. The results in the first approximation show a 2-fold increase
   in speed when using our implementation of active contours. At the same
   time, the segmented areas of crystals correspond to the approach without
   the use of multi-scale image representation. Discussion: The results of
   this work show that multiscale image representation can be applied to
   improve the speed and applicability of modern software for automated
   image analysis. The next steps will include applicability evaluation of
   multiscale representation for different cases as well as the development
   of software realizing vector processor architecture.
   Objectives: One of the objectives of hemodialysis (HD) is preserving
   optimal acid-base homeostasis. Bicarbonate is an obligatory component of
   dialysis fluids in order to titrate the acidic products of protein
   metabolism that accumulate between treatments. Even though bicarbonate
   can easily transfer across HD membranes, its plasma concentration does
   not equilibrate with that in dialysis fluid by the end of the treatment,
   for reasons unclear. We used a mathematical model to test whether an
   intradialytic increase in total non-bicarbonate buffer concentration in
   plasma (tNBBp) could explain this lack of equilibrium. Methods: We
   modified the model of CO2 and bicarbonate whole body transport proposed
   in 1995 by Rees and Andreassen, adding bicarbonate transfer from
   dialysis fluid to plasma via a dialyzer connected to an arteriovenous
   fistula. The model described the transport of O2, CO2, and base excess
   between different compartments: arterial and venous circulations,
   interstitial fluid and lung capillaries. In each compartment, equations
   describing the biochemistry of blood were solved to estimate the
   components of bicarbonate and non-bicarbonate buffer systems. Results:
   The model qualitatively described the typical intradialytic pattern of
   bicarbonate concentration, pH, base excess, CO2 and O2 partial pressures
   observed in patients under routine thrice weekly HD. Model predictions
   were compared assuming a constant or increasing tNBBp during HD. When
   tNBBp was allowed to increase, the intradialytic increase in plasma
   bicarbonate concentration was blunted and the model predictions better
   fit published time-dependent intradialytic plasma bicarbonate
   concentrations. Discussion: It was suggested in literature that HD
   treatment may stimulate an increased concentration of non-bicarbonate
   buffers and release of hydrogen ions from these organic acids. Our
   preliminary modeling results are consistent with this hypothesis and
   show that the model is capable of predicting the effect of the HD
   treatment on the buffer systems of the body.
   Objectives: To develop an implant for the bone-tendon transition, it is
   our approach to optimize polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds by coating for
   a functionalization with drug release systems. The procedure during the
   functionalization should enable a release of growth factors in a
   spatially and temporally graded way. Methods: The PCL fiber mats were
   prepared by electrospinning. Polydopamine (pDA)-based coatings were used
   to modify the surface of the fibers. To get thin polymeric, hydrophilic
   and biocompatible coatings we applied the pure pDA system and a
   co-deposition with amines (ethylenediamine (ED), hexamethylenediamine
   (HMD) and polyethyleneimine (PEI)). To functionalize our system with
   growth factors we used chitosan-based nanoparticles which can be loaded
   with the therapeutic proteins BMP-2 and TGF-beta. By a defined dipping
   procedure we generate fiber mats with a graded functionalization.
   Results: The measurement of the contact angle and the surface zeta
   potential showed a change from a hydrophobic PCL surface to a highly
   hydrophilic and amphoteric character for the coated systems. The charged
   surface enables the further functionalization with loaded nanoparticles.
   The release of BMP2 and TGF-beta from the functionalized scaffolds was
   established. With a dipping procedure we are able to functionalize our
   scaffolds in a graded way. Confocal laser scanning microscopy with
   fluorescence-labeled NP showed that we could generate up to three
   differently functionalized regions. Discussion: The results show the
   methodology is suited to prepare implants, which can release growth
   factors in a spatially and temporally controlled way. These graded
   implants can be used for in-situ tissue engineering.
   Objectives: Solute movement from blood to dialysis solution is largely
   determined by transmembrane pressure (TMP). Accordingly, it was
   imperative to develop a TMP control system that allows for the
   maintanence of constant pressure. TMP in dialyzer is one of the tasks in
   wearable artificial kidney development. In most of the known devices,
   transmembrane pressure is regulated only by adjusting the flow-pressure
   characteristics of the pump or mechanical uncontrolled clamping line.
   Methods: A system was proposed which consists of a pinch valve, a DC
   motor and a control circuit. This device allows you to automatically
   adjust the pressure. At first, the device reads data from the
   differential sensor, which measures the TMP. After that, the position of
   the moving part of the pinch valve changes and the degree of clamping of
   the line changes, which in turn affects the value of TMP. The case of
   the device was made using a 3D printer. A test bench was created in
   order to determine the effectiveness of maintaining a constant TMP. It
   consists of five parts: two circuits with two peristaltic pumps, a
   dialyzer, a differential pressure sensor and a power source. The
   pressure from the primary circuit was varied by manually clamping the
   line and the degree of pressure differential compensation by the pinch
   valve was determined. Results: The experiment showed that the TMP
   changes are fully compensated by the pinch valve. Accuracy of the
   developed device depends largely on accuracy of pressure measurement
   sensor. There was no change in the flow rate of the fluid, and this is
   important, because the rate of dialysate regeneration depends on the
   flow rate of the fluid. Discussion: The experiment showed that this
   device can be used to control TMP. Accuracy of the system allows you to
   use it in the wearable artificial kidney.
   Objectives: This paper describes the testing methods used in the
   development of software for an implantable heart monitor. It is a
   complex medical system. To identify errors made while writing software,
   as well as to detect deviations in the operation of the device in a
   timely manner, it is necessary to constantly carry out testing of all
   elements of the system. Methods: Testing methods used in the development
   of an implantable heart monitor: - debugging using JTAG, - self-test
   system, - testing via COM port, - recording test information in the
   device's internal memory (data logging), - interprocessor testing.
   Consider some of them in more detail. Debugging and testing using JTAG:
   Due to the fact that the development was carried out in Code Composer
   environment, this allowed the use of a special script language GEL
   (General Extension Language). This is an expression language used by the
   CCS debugger. Launch GEL files are used to automate software
   development. GEL is an interpreted language, and its syntax is the same
   as C. Thereby it is possible to carry out tests, and change them, or add
   new ones in the process of the main software. Logging: One of the
   testing methods is to track changes in the state of the system over
   time. One way is to write data to the device's internal memory. But in
   such a way that you can track at what point in time the change occurred.
   For this you can use time stamps. If the data is recorded strictly with
   a certain frequency, you can do without time stamps. Results: The
   presented test methods differ in that some of them can be used only in
   the early stages of development and some even when the device is at the
   end user. Discussion: Cardiovascular diseases are very dangerous and
   difficult to diagnose. Early diagnosis and prediction of these diseases
   can lead to an improvement in the quality of life of patients.
   Objectives: To clarify the reasons, beneficial effects and duration of
   AVF patency after radiological interventions in AVF stenosis. Methods:
   In 174 patients, 522 radiological investigations and endovascular
   treatments such as percutaneous trans luminal angioplasty (PTA) were
   analyzed, retrospectively. All investigations were performed due to
   clinical suspicion of impaired AVF function. Results: Arterial stenosis
   was significantly more frequent among patients with diabetes mellitus (p
   < 0.001) and interstitial nephritis (p < 0.001). According to the venous
   stenosis, the diagnosis did not affect the frequency (p=0.22), neither
   the degree of the stenosis (p=0.39). The degree of stenosis prior to PTA
   correlated significantly with the degree of remaining stenosis after
   intervention (p<0.001). Of the 174 patients, 123 (71\%) performed a
   total of 318 PTA investigations. Repeated PTA was performed
   significantly more often in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The
   median times to first PTA and to the subsequent PTAs were 9.5 months and
   5 months, respectively. Discussion: Patients with diabetic nephropathy
   are at a greater risk of getting recurrent stenosis; this motivates a
   closer follow up for these patients. Clinically significant stenosis
   should be dilated as meticulously and as soon as possible. Occlusions of
   the AVF in most instances can be successfully thrombolyzed or dilated
   upon early diagnosis.
   Objectives: Designing new ventricular assist devices to coupe two major
   challenges in the field: less invasive intervention and reducing side
   effects was our objective. Methods: Computer-aided design and
   computational fluid dynamics were performed with Solidworks 2017 to
   design and test several new bearingless centrifugal ventricular assist
   devices. Fused deposition modeling was used to build the models and
   subcutaneous implantation was simulated and transcutaneous power
   transfer was tested. Results: Two bearingless, fully implantable
   ventricular assisted devices were developed. The first is a radial flux
   motor fully magnetically levitated ventricular assist device. The second
   is an axial flux hydro-magnetically suspended rotor ventricular assist
   device. Both devices contain an internal rechargeable battery, power
   transfer coil, electronic circuit and have a cylindrical shape with
   15-20 mm height and 100 mm diameter. The flow is 3 l/min at 135 mmHg is
   achieved and efficiency of power transfer of 80\% with a 5 mm gap. The
   devices are implantable in a pectoral subcutaneous pocket with the
   inflow connected to left atrium and the outflow to subclavian artery in
   a fashion pioneered in this field by CircuLite Synergy. Discussion: Both
   devices came with innovations in motor and pump design that set the
   foundation to build the entire system in a single body low height
   cylindrical shape, optimal for subcutaneous implantation and by this
   with good transcutaneous power transfer efficiency.
   Objectives: For most in vitro cultivations of mammalian cells, culture
   medium is supplemented with serum, which contains important proteins and
   factors for the cell growth. Previous experiments showed already a
   positive effect of human platelet lysate (hPL) as a medium supplement
   for the two-dimensional (2D) cultivation of mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSC). Since 3D culture systems gain big interest for in vitro
   applications and regenerative medicine, the influence of hPL on 3D cell
   culture models must also be investigated. Semi synthetic protein not
   sign based hydrogels represent a very promising 3D cell culture
   platform, which is biocompatible and biodegradable. Methods: In our
   work, gelatine-methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels with a various degree of
   functionalization were dissolved in different hPL concentrations (0 \%,
   2.5 \%, 50 \%, 100 \% hPL). The Influence of hPL on proliferation and
   differentiation of in GelMa encapsulated MSCs were monitored and
   measured via viability assays, immunocytochemical stainings and
   microscopy. Furthermore, the influence of hPL addition on mechanical
   characteristics of GelMA hydrogels was examined by swelling studies and
   rheometric analysis. Results: The addition of hPL to GelMA hydrogels
   enhances the cell-spreading, the degree of differentiation as well as
   cell viability in concentration-depended manner. Besides, the results of
   the rheometric tests showed an increase of hydrogel stiffness by using
   higher concentrations of hPL. Discussion: Obtained results demonstrate
   that supplementation of hydrogels with hPL has a positive effect on cell
   growth and differentiation. Moreover, hPL can be a promising hydrogel
   stiffness enhancer for application in 3D bioprinting.
   Objectives: Generally, LVAD thrombosis is diagnosed only by reviewing
   online logfiles that show an increase of power consumption and flow of
   the device. In order to increase diagnostic power and improve treatment
   management, trans-thoracic echocardiography was carried out to assess
   any blood flow changes. Methods: Eight patients (M 7; F 1) experienced a
   total of 17 Heart Ware VAD thromboses. At echocardiogram, a 4-chamber
   view was obtained and the echo probe beam was aligned to blood flow of
   the inflow cannula. Continous-wave Doppler was applied for the
   assessment of: 1) the increase of flow maximal velocity (Vmax) above
   basal ranges over several cardiac cycles and 2) the irregular
   discontinous sound of the device. Online logfiles were reviewed for
   abnormal increase in power consumption and flow compared to basal data.
   All patients underwent thrombolysis with rTPA. Echocardiography results
   before and after treatment were compared. Results: Thrombolysis was
   successful in all patients; one patient died due to cerebral
   haemorrhage. Echocardiograms before thrombolysis showed an increased
   mean Vmax of 6.4 +/- 0.5 m/sec, whereas after treatment Vmax was 360 +/-
   0.2 m/sec (p < 0.001). In all cases irregular, abnormal and
   discontinuous sounds were heard in thrombosed inflow cannulae. After
   thrombolysis only washing jet sounds were heard. Before thrombolysis
   logfiles showed a mean increase of power consumption of 5.6 +/- 0.3
   watts, returning to basal values of 3.8 +/- 0.3 watts after thrombolysis
   (p<0.001). Before thrombolysis logfiles showed mean flow of 6.2 +/- 0.6
   L/min, after treatment mean flow was back to normal ranges 4.2 +/- 0.5
   L/sec (p<0.001). Discussion: Transthoracic echocardiography showed a
   significant increase of blood flows in the inflow cannula of thrombosed
   LVAD devices, confirming findings of log files review. A combined
   approach by logfiles review and echocardiography is recommended in
   patients with LVAD thrombosis.
   Objectives: Leukocyte activation is correlated to a reduced immune
   response in ventricular assist device (VAD) patients. Research has
   displayed leukocyte microparticle (MP; 200-1000nm diameter) increases
   following VAD shear stress. However, questions still arise regarding MP
   role, impact and biogenesis. MPs are plasma membrane derived, but there
   are smaller (50-100nm diameter), cytoplasmic vesicles (exosomes) which
   are often overlooked, or mistaken for MPs. As such, unless these
   vesicles are successfully separated, they should be categorised as
   extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are known to have roles in cellular
   communications and implications in diseases, and it is desirable to
   assess leukocyte sub-sets and any associated roles in VAD complications.
   Methods: Bovine blood was diluted to a haematocrit of 30 +/- 2\%
   according to ASTM standards. Blood was pumped for 6 hours in vitro with
   the CentriMag (R) centrifugal pump (Thoratec (R) Corp., USA). Flow
   cytometry determined a leukocyte EV population, having eliminated
   cellular debris. Platelet-poor plasma was tested for vesicle size and
   quantity using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), and immunoblotting
   conducted for exosome markers. Results: Flow cytometry data displayed an
   increase in leukocyte death in the CentriMag, correlating to an increase
   in leukocyte derived EV production. Further analysis determined that
   these vesicles were mainly monocyte derived, suggesting a potential
   implication in inflammation. Preliminary NTA and immunoblotting
   displayed increased EVs following shear, namely exosomes. Discussion:
   The presence of exosome marker staining and NTA size analysis displays
   evidence in favour of vesicle increase not being MP specific. As EVs
   have known implications in inflammation, infection and disease, these
   results suggest that exosomes may be associated with adverse events in
   clinical settings. Thus, exosomes should be further examined to
   elucidate any role as biomarkers of VAD related complications.
   Objectives: To investigate the influence of bone turnover markers in
   end-stage renal disease patients for severe secondary
   hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Methods: 221 ESRD patients with SHPT were
   split into two groups according to the iPTH level: Mild SHPT group
   (M-group) (iPTH130 -600 pg/ml, n=86) and severe SHPT group (S-group)
   (iPTH > 1500pg/ml, n=53). Serum BTM such as beta- CrossLaps (ss-CTX)
   procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), osteocalcin (OC) were
   detected. Results: Compared to the M-group, the patients in S-group had
   higher levels of the ss-CTX (5877.40 +/- 423.01 pg/ml, vs 3206.90 +/-
   1438.27), P=0.000, the P1NP (1145.50 +/- 171.36 ug /ml, vs 440.00 +/-
   308.12), P=0.000, the OC (258.52 +/- 48.61 ng/ml, vs 221.74 +/- 75.99
   ng/ml), P=0.000. ROC Curve analysis for the main risk factors of the
   parathyroid hyperplasia were ss-CTX, P1NP, sALP, iPTH. Discussion:
   Severe SHPT had higher levels of bone turnover markers, which may have
   aggravated CKD-MBD.
   Objectives: One of the main functions of renal replacement therapy is
   removal of excess products of metabolism from blood. Uremic toxins,
   waste products found in the blood of patients in need of renal
   replacement therapy (RRT), have very high blood concentrations and are
   harmful to the organism. Uremic toxins have been found over 100 and
   their classification is based on their molecular mass and linkage to
   proteins. EUTox, the European uremic toxin work group, has divided
   uremic toxins into 3 groups: water soluble toxins with small molecular
   mass (MM) < 500 Da (e.g. urea); middle size molecules, MM > 500 Da,
   (e.g. beta 2-microglobulin); protein-bound uremic toxins (e.g. indoxyl
   sulphate and rho-cresyl sulfate). Methods: TalTech and a spin-off
   company grown out of the university, OFT, have developed a new,
   real-time multicomponent (MCM)-sensor to monitor all uremic toxin groups
   in RRT. MCM-sensor contains miniature LED-technology to measure
   UV-absorbance and fluorescence. During online measurements, the sensor
   is connected to dialysis machine outlet with easy-to-handle connectors.
   Results: The results from a pilot clinical study at Nephrology
   Department of North Estonia Medical Centre and Nephrology Department of
   Linkoping University Hospital will be presented. The outputs of the
   sensor are on-line concentration patterns of small, middle and
   protein-bound uremic toxins in the waste dialysis and the clinical
   parameters of the uremic toxin removal (removal rate, total solute
   removal). A telemetry application enables to follow the dialytic removal
   even on remote distances. Discussion: A concept for smart real-time
   monitoring of intermittent RRT has been realized as a novel miniaturized
   optical sensor performing intradialytic on-line multicomponent uremic
   toxins monitoring in the spent dialysate.
   Objectives: Since Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) were shown to enhance neural
   outgrowth towards them, an approach with a CNT-Silicone rubber compound
   that immerses the CNTs and thus anchors them to the implant is
   investigated in an animal model Methods: To compare the CNT-silicone
   rubber to state-of-the-art neuronal implant materials, 6 variations of
   the same implant with varying exposed materials were fabricated. The
   thin-film implants consisted of a polyimide substrate and metal pathways
   encapsulated in silicone rubber. Depending on the batch, either metal or
   CNT-silicone rubber were exposed. Female mice were implanted on the
   brain and under the skin (flank area) for 60 or 180 days. After
   necropsy, the head was fixed in 4\% neutral buffered formaldehyde. After
   24h, it was stored in 70\% ethanol for another 24h and then decalcified.
   It was then trimmed, dehydrated in ascending alcohol series and xylene.
   After embedding in Technovit 8100, sections with nominal thickness of 2
   mu m were cut. The same procedure was performed on the implants and skin
   from the flank, except they were embedded in paraffin and cut into 3 mu
   m slices. Light microscopic examination of Hematoxylin and eosin stained
   slices was performed. Results: During histopathological examination,
   both findings associated with surgery and implant-related microscopic
   changes were observed in sections from the head and flank. The tissue
   around the implant showed similar reactions in all groups. Macrophages
   and inflammatory cells as well as slight fibrosis were found around the
   implant in all animals Discussion: Preparation of tissue sections
   including thin film implants was shown to be possible, yet the
   differences in material properties led to problems during cutting.
   However, usage of different embedding materials for the tissues worked.
   These first results suggest that the used CNT-Silicone rubber materials
   could be used in short term applications.
   Objectives: The properties of nanocomposite (NC) poly
   (N-isopropylacrylamide) (NIPAM) hydrogels as well as 3D printing
   techniques for hydrogels have gained a lot of significance in the tissue
   engineering community. This study aims at the development of a stable
   water based ink formulation for nanocomposite hydrogels usable by
   DLP/SLA 3D-printers in the range of 365 - 405 nm to use them e.g. for
   investigations in water flows. Methods: Diphenyl
   (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (as photo-initiator), Laponite
   XLG (as nanocomposite crosslinker), sodium dodecyl sulfate (as
   surfactant) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (as crystallization inhibitor) were
   dissolved in a N-butyl acetat and isopropanol solution at room
   temperature. This organic phase was then mixed with bi-distilled water
   and stirred for 20 minutes in a closed container to form a micro
   emulsion. The micro emulsion was flash freezed in liquid nitrogen and
   freeze dried in a Virtis Advantage Plus freeze drying unit for at least
   24 h at -50 degrees C and 0.4 mbar. The obtained powder could be
   dispersed in a NIPAM/water solution to form a stable, UV-curable ink. To
   show the applicability of hydrogels for investigating flows around
   bodies in principle, experiments in a water channel will be conducted.
   Results: The obtained ink is suitable for the most commonly used SLA and
   DLP printers in the range of 365 - 405 nm. Whereas the expected curing
   time is much higher than the curing time of commercially available
   standard polymeric printing inks due to the inhibiting effect of the
   Laponite XLG. The applicability experiments are in preparation.
   Discussion: NC-hydrogels obtain through this photo-polymerization method
   show similar mechanical properties to the standard NC-hydrogels obtained
   through radical polymerization with potassium peroxodisulfate.
   Objectives: Laser interference lithography (LIL) and the layer-by-layer
   (LbL) technique are combined here for the first time to design a system
   with variable nanotopographies and surface viscoelasticity to regulate
   cell behavior. Methods: LIL is used to generate hexagonally arranged
   nanostructures of gold with different periodicity. In contrast, LBL is
   used to assemble a multilayer system of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and
   hyaluronic acid (HA) on top of the nanostructures. Moreover, the
   viscoelastic properties of that system are controlled by chemical
   cross-linking. Results: We show that the topography designed with LIL is
   still present after multilayer deposition and that the formation of the
   multilayer system renders the surfaces hydrophilic, which is opposite to
   the hydrophobic nature of pristine nanostructures. The heterogenic
   system is applied to study the effect on adhesion and differentiation of
   human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSC). We show that hADSC spreading
   is increasing with cross-linking degree on flat multilayers, while it is
   decreasing on nanostructures modified with multilayers. In addition,
   early effects on signal transduction processes are seen. Finally, hADSC
   differentiation into chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages is superior to
   adipogenic lineages on nanostructures modified with multilayers.
   Discussion: Hence, the presented system offers great potential to guide
   stem cell differentiation on surfaces of implants and tissue engineering
   scaffolds.
   Objectives: The Gibbs-Donnan theory describes the equilibrium of ionic
   solutions separated by a semipermeable membrane, when only one solution
   contains charged macromolecules that cannot pass the membrane. The
   problem was originally formulated for simple solutions, such as
   dissociated NaCl, which allowed to calculate the ratio between ions
   concentrations at the sides of the membrane (Gibbs-Donnan factor).
   Solutions like plasma and interstitial fluid, and dialysate, contain
   however ions with different valence, and proteins in each compartment
   have a different concentration (and therefore charge); the classic
   theory needs an extension to describe these real-world scenarios. In
   this study we propose a new method to calculate Gibbs-Donnan factors for
   such more complex cases. Methods: From electroneutrality considerations
   and the definition of Nernst potential it is possible to derive a new
   expression of Gibbs-Donnan factor which depends on the total
   concentrations of ions of the same valence. This allows, for two
   solutions A and B, to calculate the concentration of all ions in
   solution B, given: 1) macromolecule concentrations in A and B, 2)
   solutes concentrations in A. The transitivity of Donnan factors was
   proved: for 3 solutions at equilibrium (A, B, C) the factor of A to C is
   equal to the ratio of the factors from A to B and B to C. Results: As a
   demonstration, the theory was applied to the calculation of the
   concentrations in interstitial fluid (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, HCO3-,
   HPO42-, SO42-, C3H5O3-) starting from values reported in literature. The
   calculated interstitial concentrations were close to the reported ones,
   with a global RMSE equal to 6\%. Discussion: The Donnan factors for
   small ions in biological fluids have relatively small deviation from
   unity, but their precise value may be of importance for ions whose
   concentrations are similar at both sides of the membrane, as for example
   sodium and calcium transport in hemodialyzers and peritoneal dialysis.
   Objectives: Biobanking of in vitro engineered tissues presents obvious
   advantages associated with flexible preparation and shipping scheduling.
   To provide sufficient cryoprotection, alternative research models,
   freezing approaches and cryoprotective agents (CPAs) have to be
   established in view of complexity and diversity of composite tissues.
   Here, we evaluated the effects of conventional freezing (CF) and
   directional freezing (DF) for cryopreservation of cell-seeded
   electrospun fiber mats. Methods: Fiber mats were produced from
   polycaprolactone and polylactic acid (PCL-PLA, ratio 200:100) using
   electrospinning. Structure of electrospun mats was characterized using
   SEM and FTIR, whereas their heat capacity was determined using DSC. The
   square-shape mats (1x1 cm, UV-sterilized) were seeded with HeLa cells
   (5x104/scaffold) and cultivated at static conditions. Samples were
   frozen using 1 K/min to -80 degrees C (CF) or with the directional ice
   growth at the speed of 30 mu m/sec over a 2.6 mm gradient gap (from -4
   to -10 degrees C) i.e. 4 K/min followed by further cooling to -20
   degrees C at 1 K/min (translational cryostage) and to -80 degrees C with
   1 K/min (LN flow cooling stage). The viability of cells was evaluated 24
   h after thawing using fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide
   staining. Results: PCL-PLA mats exhibited no cytotoxicity on HeLa cells
   in vitro (viability higher than 90\%). Only single cells survived both
   CF and DF when frozen in culture medium (negative control). In contrast,
   the majority of cells on fiber mats were alive after freezing under
   protection of DMSO. Discussion: We showed that although not yet
   optimized, DF was as effective as CF for cryopreservation of cell-seeded
   PCL-PLA fiber mats. Preliminary studies on using antifreeze protein Type
   III (AFPIII) (10 and 100 mu M) as a sole CPA indicates that
   extracellular protection might not be enough to prevent freezing injury.
   Our recent work on electroporation of cells within electrospun fiber
   mats yielded encouraging results and the further initiative will be to
   deliver AFPs into cells using electroporation to provide DMSO-free
   cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs.
   Objectives: Computational tools for accurate evaluation of healthcare
   products are increasingly being recognized by the European Parliament,
   US Congress and FDA and represent a highly valuable tool for speeding up
   and reducing investments associated with the demanding certification
   process of medical devices. InSilicoTrials Technologies is developing a
   collaborative, automatized cloud-based platform to assist medical device
   and pharma companies in performing modelling and simulation activities
   to accelerate medical innovation while responding to recommendations of
   European and US parliaments and regulatory bodies. Methods: Simulations
   provided by scientific partners are integrated within a secured and
   privacy-preserved environment, ultimately providing the users
   (companies, research and clinical centers) with in silico solutions for
   different steps of the R\&D process on medical devices and drugs.
   Simulation results as well as an automatically created simulation report
   can be formatted in conformity with guidelines provided by EMA and FDA
   while taking in consideration the new European Medical Device
   Regulation. Results: Tools currently hosted on the platform are: NuMRIs,
   an automatic tool to assess magnetic resonance imaging radio-frequency
   safety of medical devices, implemented in collaboration with the US FDA
   Center for Devices and Radiological Health and ANSYS. QT/TdP Risk
   Screen, an automated tool to assess drug-induced pro-arrhythmic and
   Torsade de Pointes risk of small molecules, developed in collaboration
   with Universitat Politecnica de Valencia and Fundacio' Institut Mar
   d'Investigations Mediques. Discussion: The use of computational
   technologies to support med registration is limited in scope or absent
   while the agencies are promoting the use of M\&S in R\&D and
   registration. This causes a gap in know-how between reality of the
   industry and regulatory expectations. InSilicoTrials bridges these gaps
   and helps industries to conform to regulatory recommendations in a
   timely and cost-effective manner.
   Objectives: Dialyzer design enhancing internal filtration may be
   beneficial to remove middle molecules from the patient's blood for the
   treatment of renal pathologies. Mathematical models have been proposed
   to predict the rate of internal filtration, at varying dialyzer geometry
   and operating conditions. However, such models generally consist of
   difficult differential equations, that may not be easily used and
   implemented in clinical practice. In this work, an analytical model to
   predict internal filtration, at varying dialyzer geometry and operating
   conditions, is presented. Methods: To identify an analytical formula
   allowing for the prediction of internal filtration, the Poiseuille
   equation was used to describe axial momentum transport in the blood and
   dialysate compartment, assuming constant fluid viscosities, whereas
   radial momentum transport across the membrane was described with the
   Darcy equation, assuming linear ultrafiltration flux. The model was
   validated by comparing the pressure profiles in blood and dialysate
   compartments, and the rate of internal filtration predicted by the model
   with experimental data reported in literature for in-house Theranova 400
   dialyzer. Results: An analytical formula to predict the rate of internal
   filtration at varying dialyzer geometry and operating conditions was
   obtained. Very good agreement (i.e. percentage error lower than 2\%) was
   found between model predictions and experimental data for blood flow
   rate increasing from 300 to 400 ml/min, at constant dialyzer flow rate
   and zero net ultrafiltration flow rate. Good agreement was also found
   between internal filtration predicted by the analytical model presented
   in this work, and that predicted by using other one-dimensional
   mathematical models reported in literature. Discussion: The analytical
   model presented in this work agrees well with experimental data, and can
   be used predict the rate of internal filtration at varying dialyzer
   geometry and operating conditions.
   Objectives: Despite the growing acceptance of LVAD therapy, concerns
   relating to adverse events have been raised. Fields such as implantation
   techniques, patient management and patient selection pose opportunities
   to advance outcomes, however, new and enhanced device technology, such
   as the ReinVAD LVAD, will have to contribute to improve and grow the
   therapy. Methods: The ReinVAD GmbH was founded as spin-off company of
   the Helmholtz-Institute of the RWTH Aachen University, Germany, and
   leads the development project to regulatory approval and clinical
   application. The core technology is a miniaturized, 3(rd) generation,
   centrifugal blood pump. It is the result of a multidisciplinary research
   and development program equipping the system with features that will
   improve outcome for bridge to transplantation and especially destination
   therapy patients. Results: Chronic trials typically up to 90 days in a
   sheep confirm the capabilities of the system with excellent resistance
   to thrombogenicity since no design related thrombus could be found
   despite ceased anti-coagulation after 6 weeks. Implemented features are
   a pump for partial and full support with flow up to 10 l/min, a fully
   integrated flow sensor, an implantable driveline connector, a highly
   pressure-sensitive pump characteristic, an automated speed controller
   and a user-friendly one-piece extracorporeal system. The sensor provides
   real flow measurements. The driveline connector ensures easy exchange in
   case of infections and renders the system ready-for-TET. The pump
   pressure sensitivity, among other effects, leads to increased exercise
   capacity and arterial pulsation. The controller ensures that the pump
   always operates at its optimal speed. The one-piece extracorporeal
   system reduces use errors and improves satisfaction with this component
   of everyday life. Discussion: The results indicate that the ReinVAD LVAD
   will be an effective system to enhance long-term circulatory support
   therapy.
   Objectives: Cardiovascular diseases shorten life span of hemodialysis
   (HD) patients. Recently pentraxin 3 (PTX) was considered as a biomarker
   of cardiac function, as well as an inflammatory biomarker. The aim of
   this study was to investigate if PTX was a useful biomarker to estimate
   patients' cardiac condition more than as inflammatory biomarker by
   analysing plasma in PTX, CRP, NT-pro-BNP (Pro-BNP) and troponin T before
   and after HD. Methods: Twenty patients on chronic HD were studied in a
   prospective cross-over study with three modes of HD with polysulfone
   dialyzers: (a) dry-stored (F8HPS, Fresenius) with a low blood level in
   the venous chamber (DL), (b) dry-stored with a blood level kept high
   (DH), and (c) a wet-stored dialyzer (Rexeed18L, Asahi Kasei Medical)
   with high level (WH). PTX, CRP, Pro-BNP and troponin T were assessed
   before and during 180 min of HD. Results: The mean value of PTX at
   baseline was correlated to Pro-BNP (rho=0.52, p<0.001) and troponin T
   (rho=0.363, p= 0.005), but there was no correlation to CRP. The mean
   value of PTX was significantly increased at 180 min (by 57\%) compared
   to baseline data (p<0.001). The baseline values of PTX correlated with
   the extent of rise of PTX (rho=0.89, p<0.001), such as a higher baseline
   was related with more extensive increase. The mean difference value of
   PTX between baseline to 180 min of HD was correlated to that of
   Pro-BNP(rho=0.31, p=0.025), while there was no correlation to that of
   troponin T nor CRP. PTX rose less while on WH than on DL (mean 2.9 +/-
   1.4 vs 3.8 +/- 2.8, p=0.025). There was no difference in PTX at baseline
   among these three settings. Discussion: These data indicate that PTX is
   a more evident marker for the influence of the cardiac condition than an
   inflammatory marker during HD. Dialysis with WH causes least air
   contamination to the patient what may be a plausible reason for the
   difference.
   Objectives: Amniotic membrane (AM) is applied in variety of clinical
   settings, mainly in wound healing and as a biological dressing.
   Currently, AM is used in ophthalmology for the treatment of cornea
   pathologies. In this study, the regenerative potential of human amniotic
   membrane after cryopreservation was evaluated. Methods: AM was prepared
   under sterile conditions and frozen without cryoprotectants at -80
   degrees C. Native non-cryopreserved AM served as a control. The strategy
   for AM cryopreservation included one or two freezing and thawing cycles.
   Cytokine and growth factor profiles as well as morphology and mechanical
   properties of AM were compared before and after one and two cycles of
   cryopreservation. Levels of EGF, HGF, TGF-beta 1, bFGF, Laminin and
   Hyaluronic acid were measured by ELISA. Surface structure of the
   membrane was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Morphology
   was evaluated by histological analyses after Hematoxylin Eosin (HE)
   staining. Additionally, biomechanical characteristics, such as the
   modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) and the tensile strength, were
   also investigated. Results: EGF, HGF, TGF-beta 1, bFGF, Laminin and
   Hyaluronic acid were detected in all studied samples. No significant
   differences were detected in the levels of those cytokines before and
   after cryopreservation. SEM analysis showed minor structural alterations
   of double cryopreserved samples. Analysis of HE stained AM showed minor
   changes between native and frozen membranes, such as few areas with
   desquamated epithelium which was caused by repeating freezing and
   thawing cycles. Mechanical tests did not reveal relevant changes between
   frozen and non-frozen samples. Discussion: Multiple cryopreservation
   steps are an essential part of manufacturing of human amniotic membranes
   to ensure a ready-to-use product availability. This study demonstrated
   that the cryopreservation does not impair the regenerative potential of
   AM required to support its therapeutic efficacy.
   Objectives: Cells are used in bioartificial organs (BAOs) to temporarily
   replace the complex metabolic functions that neither failing organs, nor
   their artificial substitutes may provide. This makes cell bioreactors a
   critical technology for BAOs development. Bioreactors are used for
   expanding stem (SCs), precursor (PCs), or line cells to clinical mass,
   for promoting SCs and PCs differentiation to the needed phenotype, and
   for providing patients with the organ regulatory and synthetic functions
   needed to foster organ healing or maintain patients state until
   transplantation (Tx). In some cases, they are also used to regenerate or
   preserve tissue until Tx. The structural and functional complexity of
   tissues and organs, the lack of information on their pathophysiology and
   on disease/damage evolution, the treatment time broadly varying with
   patients disease and state, all make bioreactor design and operation for
   BAOs very challenging. Methods: In spite of its complexity, cell
   bioreactors design for BAOs is generally based on the use of one cell
   type only (often line cells), scaffolds with suitable immune protective
   properties, and bioreactor configurations suitable for hosting clinical
   cell mass and intellectual property protection. Bioreactor performance
   has been enhanced with actuators to provide cells with mechanical,
   electrical and/or magnetic cues, often irrespective of tissue or organ
   specificity. Thus far, this approach has resulted in poor therapeutic
   success of the proposed BAOs. Results: Cell bioreactor design for BAOs
   may benefit of the approaches developed over the years to bioreactor
   design for engineering or regenerating 3D tissue or large solid organs
   in vitro. Discussion: Prospectively, future approaches to cell
   bioreactor design for BAOs should be patterned after those typical of
   tissue engineering and should aim to the optimization of the BAO
   treatment as a whole.
   Objectives: To find the most appropriate lock solution for central
   venous catheters to prevent catheter-related complications. Methods:
   Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were
   systematically searched up to August 2018. We included randomized
   controlled trials comparing different lock solutions for adult dialysis
   patients (> 18 years old). The trials should report at least one primary
   or secondary outcome. Network meta-analyses of outcomes were performed
   using the netmeta 0.9-6 package in R (version 3.5.1). Other analyses
   were carried out by means of the network and network graphs packages in
   Stata version 15.0. Results: 50 trials (7142 patients) were included for
   this study. Compared with heparin 5000U/ml, antibiotic locks
   (antibiotics with TSC, EDTA, heparin 5000U/ml, low-dose heparin, or
   urokinase) and ethanol locks were more effective in preventing
   catheter-related bloodstream infections. Antimicrobial agents plus
   low-dose heparin (500-2500 U/ml), TSC and low-dose heparin locks had
   lower risk of bleeding events than heparin 5000 U/ml. No lock solution
   reduced rates of catheter malfunction and all-cause mortality compared
   with heparin 5000 U/ml. In summary, antibiotics plus low-dose heparin
   was ranked as the best lock solution. Considering the toxicity and drug
   resistance of antibiotics, ethanol could be the alternative
   antimicrobial lock solution. The overall results were not materially
   changed in sensitivity analyses. Discussion: In total, according to the
   two-dimensional graph, antimicrobial agents plus low-dose heparin
   (500-2500 U/ml) was the highest ranking lock solution, as it reduced the
   rates of CRBSI and the risk of bleeding significantly. Ethanol was the
   promising alternative antimicrobial lock solution of antibiotics to
   combine with anticoagulant agents. TSC alone did not prevent CRBSI, but
   it is safe.
   Objectives: The Fontan procedure is the current standard and the best
   palliative treatment for most patients with a functional univentricular
   heart. During the Fontan procedure the caval veins are anastomosed to
   the pulmonary arteries. The resulting total cavopulmonary connection
   (TCPC) allows for the support of an acceptable level of pulmonary
   circulation. At the same time there is the high risk of cardiovascular
   system failure due to the increased load on a single ventricle. In order
   to increase patient survival and quality of life, the different TCPC
   connections aimed at improving blood hemodynamic seems to be a logical
   treatment option. Methods: A CFD study was carried out for four types of
   TCPC (TCPC-1, TCPC-2, TCPC-3, TCPC-4) to determine the optimal
   connection from the point of view of hydraulic and power losses with and
   without the rotary blood pump (RBP) connected. The distribution of
   scalar shear stresses (SSS) in the volume was calculated, allowing for
   evaluation of the effect of the RBP on the blood at the operating point
   of 2.2 l/min and 11 mmHg of head pressure. Results: The results showed
   that the TCPC-3 connection has the optimal geometry, as there is a
   decrease in hydraulic losses corresponding to 5 mmHg, with power losses
   of 0.055 W. Hydraulic losses and power losses for other types of TCPC
   are equal to 6 mmHg and 0.07 W for TCPC-2, 9 mmHg and 0.08 W for TCPC-4,
   10 mmHg and 0.09 W for TCPC-1 respectively. The geometry optimization of
   the TCPC connection can significantly reduce the system losses, but only
   the integration of the RBP prevents these losses even for non-optimal
   TCPC. Discussion: Although the use of a pump has significantly reduced
   losses, the presence of increased SSS can have a negative effect on
   blood. The obtained values of SSS will allow in the future the
   estimation of the degree of blood damage and, as a consequence,
   hemolysis level.
   Objectives: The complex tree-like architecture of the lungs that ends
   with tiny alveolar sacs is difficult to mimic in-vitro. The delicate and
   ultra-thin alveolar barrier with its air-liquid interface is constantly
   exposed to the rhythmic respiratory movements. We report here about two
   organs-on-chip models that uniquely reproduce this environment and in
   which patients `cells are cultured. A first model recapitulates an array
   of alveoli with in-vivo dimensions using a biological stretchable
   membrane. The second model mimics a functional lung capillary network.
   Methods: The key part of the lung alveolar model is a biological
   membrane made of collagen and elastin (CE) that is pipetted on a gold
   mesh, whose pores correspond to the alveolar size (about 200um). Once
   the dried CE-membrane is rehydrated, primary human cells (alveolar
   epithelial and endothelial) can be cultured on both sides. The second
   model is based on the self-assembly of endothelial cells and pericytes
   that are confined in fibrin gel in microengineered compartments.
   Results: A functional alveolar barrier made of primary human alveolar
   epithelial cells and lung endothelial cells is reported. The
   CE-membrane, on which the cells are cultured, is thin (a few
   micrometers), porous (enables the culture of cells at the air-liquid
   interface during several days), and stretchable. The reported lung
   microvasculature made of self-assembled endothelial cells and pericytes
   is perfusable, vasoactive (contracts in presence of phenylephrine, a
   vasoconstrictor) and is permeable. Discussion: These advanced in-vitro
   models enable mimicking the lung parenchymal environment in an
   unprecedented way. As a result, the cultured tissues made of primary
   human lung cells are able to maintain organ-specific functions, such as
   air-blood barrier tightness and microvascular perfusability and
   contractility. Organs-on-chip solutions, such as those presented here,
   may open new possibilities for specific tissue engineering applications.
   Objectives: Development of simple and effective technologies for cell
   storage at positive temperatures facilitates to extend their use and
   ensures safe transport between research and clinical centers. The aim is
   to study the viability and metabolic activity of human mesenchymal
   stromal cells (MSCs) encapsulated in alginate microspheres (AMS) during
   storage at positive temperatures. Methods: The experiments were
   performed on human dermal MSCs derived from adult donors after their
   informed consent. MSCs in suspension and in AMS were stored in sealed
   cryovials at 4, 22 and 37 degrees C. Cell viability and metabolic
   activity were evaluated by MTT- and AlamarBlue-tests and the ability to
   adhere to the culture plastic. Mitochondrial membrane potential was
   assessed with fluorescent dye JC-1. Differentiation potential was
   evaluated after cells induction to osteogenic and adipogenic lineages.
   Results: Encapsulation in AMS supported viability and metabolic activity
   of MSCs during storage in culture medium at ambient temperature at list
   for 3 days. Storage of MSCs under hypothermic conditions (4 degrees C)
   using special media contributed to a longer sustainability of cell
   viability. During storage alginate encapsulated cells retained the
   ability to multilineage differentiation, but had lower metabolic
   activity and mitochondrial membrane potential than cells in monolayer.
   On release from alginate microspheres, the cells were shown to attach,
   reverse metabolic activity and proliferate in a similar manner to that
   seen before encapsulation. Discussion: Encapsulation in alginate
   microspheres may be considered as a cheap and robust alternative to
   cryopreservation for the shirt-term storage and transport of cells for
   clinical and research projects.
   Objectives: In case of organ failure, several options can theoretically
   be considered, thanks to the progresses in medicine, materials science
   and biotechnology: i) transplant the same organ from a donor, ii)
   replace the functions of the failing organ by an artificial one, iii)
   repair its structure thanks to cell therapy or iv) engineer a new one in
   vitro before its implantation. Methods: As far as abdominal organs
   (kidney, liver, pancreas), the history of organ replacement follows
   different ways that will be considered. In addition to medical and
   scientific hurdles, economical or ethical issues can drive the choices
   for the ``best{''} solution for the patient. Results: The case of
   pancreas is very specific since its transplantation is not the first
   option chosen to treat the failing organs, whereas it represents the
   gold standard for the liver and the kidney. In the case of liver, we
   still have to face the lack of purely artificial organ to treat acute
   liver failure or even chronic disease. Discussion: This is due to the
   complexity of the organs and the variety of its functions, some of them
   remaining relatively unknown. In this case, the option of engineering
   new liver in vitro combining hepatic cells of different phenotypes with
   an adequate matrix allowing high blood perfusion appears as the most
   promising option. Several approaches have been proposed, starting from
   the ``basic{''} use of a semi-permeable hollow fiber membrane to host
   the cells to the bioprinting of the whole organ. We will discuss here
   the pros and cons of these different strategies.
   SensorStim Neurotechnology GmbH is a start-up of the TU Berlin. The
   business area is medical engineering based on neurostimulation and
   eHealth for rehabilitation and homecare. Our vision is to help people
   with limited mobility due to paralysis, spasticity or pain and to
   mobilize them with technical assistance. Our novel medical device
   enables the use of noninvasive neurostimulation for rehabilitation and
   therapy of people with disabilities after damage to the central nervous
   system - brain, spinal cord, pyramidal tract. It is mobile, easy to use
   and it can be used in water, too. Our device consists of a
   neurostimulator combined with body sensors and can be operated via a
   smart App. Furthermore, it can be used for clinical and home care. After
   a successful market entry, we further want to support walking, cycling
   and aqua gymnastics with electrical stimulation. We started in 2018 and
   are currently funded by grants of the Federal Ministry of Education and
   Research (BMBF), Investitionsbank Berlin (IBB) and private equity and
   development cooperations. By the end of 2019, we plan to achieve CE
   marking for our first product and ISO 13485 certification for our
   quality management system.
   Objectives: Intraventricular flow patterns during mechanical circulatory
   support (MCS) cannot be accessed by clinical imaging; therefore, either
   computational or in-vitro models are used. However, the complex anatomy
   of the heart cannot be replicated and simulations inherently rely on
   assumptions and simplifications. In an isolated porcine heart setup the
   feasibility of flow measurements by Echocardiographic Particle Image
   Velocimetry (E-PIV) was evaluated. Methods: Similar to cardiac
   transplantation, porcine hearts (n=8, animal weight: 80-106 kg) were
   excised and connected to the isolated heart setup. After resuscitation
   using blood as perfusate, a rotary blood pump was implanted,
   microbubbles were injected via the left atrium at different support
   situations and echocardiographic 3-chamber-view B-mode images were
   recorded with the highest possible frame rate of up to 141 Hz (Philips
   iE33, X5-1 xMatrix probe). By iterative PIV algorithms using correlation
   domain averaging and beam sweep correction, flow fields were evaluated
   for the different hemodynamic situations. Results: All hearts were
   successfully resuscitated in the isolated heart setup and different
   hemodynamic situations were adjusted. In the unsupported heart
   physiologic flow patterns with a large clockwise vortex structure that
   warrants washout of the whole cardiac chamber were found. With
   increasing MCS (2200-2700 rpm) the formation of this flow feature is
   diminished caused by the additional flow sink at the apex. In full
   support, without aortic valve opening in the left ventricular outflow
   tract, a stagnant structure was identified, that might be connected to
   thromboembolic events. Discussion: For the first time, the contribution
   of the mitral valve apparatus to blood flow patterns especially in the
   LVOT, which may be linked to energy loss, thrombus formation and valve
   deterioration during MCS was investigated under realistic conditions.
   Objectives: In order to determine the most effective ratio of liver
   cells (LC) and multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells of bone marrow (MSC
   BM) into implantable cell-engineering constructs (CECs) used for a
   correcting of chronic liver failure (CLF). Methods: In order to create
   liver CECs we employed a biopolymer implant - a composition of a
   heterogeneous collagen-containing gel, which concluded viable LC and MSC
   BM in ratios:1:1, 5:1 and 10:1 respectively. CECs with different ratios
   of LC and MSC BM were implanted into the livers of rats (n=40) in which
   CLF was modeled by using CCl4. The efficiency of the regulatory effects
   of CECs (with different cell ratios) on regenerative processes in livers
   were assessed by using biochemical, morphological and morphometric
   methods at different periods after their implantation. Results: During
   studying of the liver CECs with various ratios of LC and MSC BM (1:1,
   5:1, 10:1), it was found that the most optimal ratio of cells into the
   CECs was 5:1, because at such ratio of cells the most distinct
   normalization of morphological and functional liver parameters as well
   as maintenance of the structural homeostasis within the CECs took place
   within 365 days after modeling CLF. Discussion: The effective correction
   of CLF can be carried out by using the implanted liver CECs, in which
   donor liver cells and MSC BM are presented in ratios - 1:1, 5:1 and
   10:1. But analysis of prolonged correction of liver morphological and
   functional parameters at CECs using allows to recommend the preference
   using of CECs using with ratio 5:1, because prolonged preservation of
   structural homeostasis into themselves CECs makes possible to
   prognosticate their prolonged regulatory action on the liver tissue at
   CLF, especially for recipients on a waiting list for liver
   transplantation.
   Conventional hemolysis researches were performed under mainly constant
   shear stress, however, real flow in vivo would be under fluctuating
   shear stress. In addition, several conventional numerical simulations
   predicted abrupt shear stress fluctuation in the blood pumps in short
   time period. Furthermore, it was also reported that erythrocyte showed
   its unique viscoelastic shape change response to sinusoidal changing
   shear stress. Based on such information, we hypothesized that abrupt
   shear change would be additional hemolysis factor in addition to
   conventional shear stress and its exposure time. Therefore, the purpose
   of this study was to examine the feasibility of such our hypothesis. We
   developed special cylindrical shear chamber which can generate varying
   shear stress by controlling the rotational speed. This study used the
   shear device to generate several trapezoidal waveforms of shear
   stresses. In such shear fluctuation, the maximal shear stress of
   approximate 22.5 Pa were loaded to porcine whole blood for 5.0 seconds.
   And the time series integrated shear stress was set to equal between
   abrupt and slow shear change conditions. Then, generated hemolysis
   levels were compared between them. Each comparative studies were
   performed for twelve times. Furthermore, such studies were repeated
   under several different shear change speeds. The result of our all
   comparison showed greater hemolysis amount at abruptly fluctuating shear
   condition. Such results successfully validated our hypothesis.
   Objectives: Ex vivo platelet production in microfluidic bioreactors is a
   promising alternative to platelet donation for transfusion therapy.
   Platelets are formed by fragmentation of large bone marrow cells called
   megakaryocytes (MK). Hydrodynamic forces play a major role in the
   formation of platelets. In this work, we design microfluidic chips where
   isolated MK are exposed to hydrodynamic forces and we characterize their
   elongation and fragmentation. Methods: Polydimethylsiloxane chips are
   fabricated using standard soft lithography protocols and sealed to a
   glass slide. The 50 mu m deep rectangular chambers contain rows of 30 mu
   m-wide adhesive pillars. Human CD34+ cells isolated from umbilical cord
   blood are differentiated in vitro for 12 days to yield mature MK and
   infused with a concentration of 2x10(5) /mL into the chips at a wall
   shear rate of 1800s(-1). Their elongation and fragmentation is monitored
   by videomicroscopy. Images were analysed using ImageJ. Results: We
   perform a spatio-temporal analysis of MK elongation and show that
   platelet release is always preceded by a remodeling of the cell that
   spans over about 20 minutes, followed by a local, sudden increase in
   elongation velocity (5-fold increase in the 10 seconds prior to
   fragmentation). The amplitude of these variations is much larger than
   the spatial and temporal variations in the surrounding flow field.
   Discussion: Earlier studies have shown that dynamic conditions for in
   vitro platelet production not only accelerates the process but also
   enhances the quality of released platelets. Here, we show that MK
   elongation and fragmentation, though accelerated by the flow, are not
   solely governed by fluid-structure interactions. It seems that other
   mechanisms are involved in the regulation of platelet release,
   preventing it to occur before the platelet is fully functional.
   Objectives: The Eulerian version of the strain-based hemolysis model has
   already shown to predict different critical regions in blood pumps
   compared to the commonly used stress-based models. Where the
   stress-based model assumes an instantaneous deformation of red blood
   cells (RBCs) due to the action of fluid forces, the strain-based model
   is able to estimate the viscoelastic deformation of RBCs. Thus, the
   effect of exposure time is considered in a natural way. However, both
   models are based on the empirical power law assumption for hemoglobin
   transport and turned out to overpredict hemolysis compared to
   experimental data. In order to improve the prediction of free-plasma
   hemoglobin, the strain-based model is combined with a multiscale model
   for hemoglobin transport. The model is able to account for pore
   formation in the RBC membrane and the resulting hemoglobin mass transfer
   into the blood plasma. Thus, the model does not rely on the power law
   assumption. Methods: The formation of pores is computed based on an
   energy balance of the stretched RBC membrane, where an area strain can
   be computed by the tensor equation of the strain-based model. The
   hemoglobin release is modeled by a transport equation with a mass
   transfer coefficient as a function of shear, which can be fitted to the
   data of blood shearing experiments. As an application, the model is used
   for a benchmark blood pump provided by the FDA. Results: The estimated
   total hemolytic performance for the benchmark blood pump is
   significantly reduced compared to the power law version of the
   strain-based model. The new results are in good agreement with the
   measured data by the FDA. Discussion: The multiscale model for
   hemoglobin transport turns out to be a useful extension of the
   strain-based hemolysis model, allowing for an overall more physical
   model description of the hemolysis process. Application to different
   devices and blood shearing experiments should be investigated in the
   future, in order to study the parameter sensitivity.
   Objectives: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane enclosed
   structures, which are released from all types of cells upon activation.
   Two examples for the role of EVs in extracorporeal therapies will be
   discussed in detail, (i) EVs as markers for cellular activation and (ii)
   EVs as platform for the binding of plasma proteins. We assessed the
   impact of regional citrate anticoagulation (2.8 vs. 5.6 mM) on the
   cellular activation in lipoprotein apheresis, using EVs as marker for
   cellular activation upon blood-adsorbent interaction. Moreover, we
   studied the ability of a commercial adsorbent (PentraSorb) for
   C-reactive protein (CRP) to remove both, soluble and EV-associated CRP
   from septic plasma. Methods: EVs were characterized in human blood or
   plasma via flow cytometry after calibration with fluorescent silica
   beads (1 mu m, 0.5 mu m, 0.3 mu m; Kisker Biotech).
   Phosphatidylserine-exposing EVs were identified as lactadherin-positive
   events in the EV gate. Antibodies against cell specific surface markers
   (CD41 for platelets, CD235a for red blood cells) were used to identify
   the cellular origin of EVs. An anti-CRP antibody was used to identify
   CRP carrying EVs. Results: During lipoprotein apheresis, platelet
   adhesion to the adsorbent polymer and EV release were associated with
   elevated markers for platelet activation and EV release was dependent on
   the citrate concentration in the extracorporeal circuit. Septic plasma
   contained significantly elevated levels of EVs, CRP+ EVs, as well as
   soluble CRP as compared to healthy donors. Incubation of plasma with the
   CRP adsorbent resulted in almost complete depletion of soluble CRP, and
   remaining EVs did not show any association with CRP, indicating
   detachment of CRP from the EVs. Discussion: In the context of apheresis,
   EVs can be considered as markers for cellular activation. Moreover, our
   data show that EVs can serve as a platform for the binding of CRP, which
   has been suggested to induce conformational changes of CRP and a shift
   towards pro-inflammatory characteristics.
   Objectives: In developing endovascular treatment devices, understanding
   their physical properties is one of the most important points. We have
   been developed film-type sensor for force measurement, applied to the
   field of biomechanics. In this study, the blood vessel model embedded
   pressure film sensor was fabricated and the contact pressure
   distribution in the circumferential direction was measured at balloon
   dilatation. Methods: The film sensor was constructed by a couple of
   patterned electrodes and pressure-sensitive layer. The film sensor was
   rolled and embedded to straight-shape silicone vessel model. The balloon
   catheter was expanded in a mock vessel. Results: The measured pressure
   at the mock vessel increased according to balloon dilatation pressure.
   At expanding of general balloon, the measured pressure at each point was
   almost the same. When expanding a scoring balloon, a balloon with wedge
   elements, the measured pressure at wedge contact points was higher than
   that of the other parts. Discussion: It is considerable that stress
   concentration state changes depending on the wedge shape and/or
   stiffness. The mock vessel is useful to understand dilatation property
   of scoring balloon.
   Objectives: Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is used to treat
   acute respiratory and circulatory failure. Recent advancements have led
   to impressive improvements in treatment results. Now clinicians urge for
   an ever-earlier ECMO application and a broadening of the indications:
   Mobility demand -> Every ECMO patient needs to be transported under
   severely restricted space conditions. Cost demand -> With rising ECMO
   numbers the cost ratio plays an increasing role for healthcare
   economics. Methods: A novel system uses a recombination of existing
   technologies to create a straightforward solution with a size and
   complexity reduction. The key principle is the sourcing of pump energy
   from the oxygen pressure, which is required to ventilate the oxygenator
   anyway. This modification allows a purely pneumatic operation and the
   usage of pulsatile pumps. Results: A pneumatically powered dual chamber
   pulsatile pump has been developed which avoids suction and high shear
   rates with improved wash out behaviour for the entire ECC system. The
   innovative pump is driven completely pneumatically without a complex and
   expensive driving console. Furthermore, a novel oxygenator has been
   developed. Initial prototypes of pumps and oxygenators have been
   optimized during multiple design iterations and tested in terms
   hydraulic characteristics and gas exchange properties on the bench using
   water glycerol and porcine blood. The entire system has a reduced
   surface area and priming volume and shows low internal pressure loss,
   excellent wash out and gas exchange parameters. The bench test results
   have been confirmed within a chronic GLP in vivo study in large animals.
   The new device's size and complexity have been significantly reduced
   compared to the state of the art systems. Discussion: The novel approach
   brings many advantages for the next generation ECMO/ECLS systems
   particularly in terms of function, mobility and cost-effectiveness.
   Objectives: The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
   standards recommend bovine blood for in vitro testing of medical
   devices. Haemodilution is used to standardise haematocrit (HCT) to 30
   +/- 2\% with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Research has shown that
   PBS increases red blood cell mechanical fragility and significantly
   increases haemolysis. Thus, the objective of this study was to
   investigate the impact of diluent and dilution for in vitro testing,
   which may result in future considerations for ASTM standards. Methods:
   Bovine blood was diluted with either PBS or PBS+4g\% BSA (bovine serum
   albumin) to a HCT of 30 +/- 2\%. The blood was either pumped with the
   CentriMag (R) (Thoratec,USA) device under haemodynamic conditions or
   exposed to VAD-like shear for 6 hours. Blood was diluted to a range of
   70-94\% (n=40). Plasma free haemoglobin levels were measured to
   calculate the normalised index of haemolysis (NIH). Protein
   concentrations were measured. Results: Haemodilution altered mechanical
   fragility depending on diluent and concentration. At a 70\% blood
   dilution, PBS alone caused significantly higher haemolysis than PBS+4g\%
   BSA. However, at a 90\% blood dilution, PBS+4g\% BSA caused
   significantly higher haemolysis than PBS alone. As such, a positive
   correlation was observed between dilution with PBS alone and NIH,
   whereas a negative correlation was observed between dilution with
   PBS+4g\% BSA and NIH. Total protein concentration was significantly
   reduced at a 70\% blood dilution with PBS alone but not at 90\%.
   Discussion: To reach a HCT of 30\%+/- 2\%, this study recommends that
   bovine blood with a HCT of > 37\% should be diluted with PBS + 4g\% BSA
   (>80\% blood dilution), whereas blood with a HCT of <37\% should be
   diluted with PBS alone (<80\% blood dilution). Haemodilution with BSA
   maintains physiological protein concentrations and may reduce bias
   during haemolysis testing with high dilutions. Thus, ASTM standards
   could consider including BSA as a diluent, when needed.
   Objectives: Obtaining normal serum potassium level is an important goal
   in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Hyperkalemia is known to be
   associated with mortality. In this study we aimed to access the
   relationship between pre-dialysis potassium level, nutritional status
   and survival in dialysis patients. Methods: This study used annual
   cohort of hemodialysis patients with 36 months of follow up. To
   determine the impact of potassium level on mortality, patients were
   followed from first potassium measurement until death or a censoring
   event; hypokalemia was defined by potassium levels below 5.5 mmol/l and
   albumin levels below 35g/l was considered an index for undernourished.
   Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to estimate the
   association between potassium level and mortality. Results: 199 patients
   were included in the study. Mean age was approximately 56 years, about
   59\% were men and 23\% had end-stage renal disease caused by diabetes.
   Albumin below 35g/l was observed in 26 (13\%) of the patients. In the
   follow up period 40 (20\%) patients died, comprising 24 (32\%) of the 74
   hypokalemic and 16 (19\%) of 82 hyperkalemic patients. The Kaplan-Meier
   survival rate was significantly longer in the hyperkalemic population
   (34.30 +/- 0.71 vs 31.06 +/- 1.16, p=0.055). Hypokalemia, when defined
   as serum potassium 5.5 pound mmol/l, was associated with all-cause
   mortality (hazards ratio (HR) 1.857, 95\% CI 0.986-3.496, p = 0.051).
   The significance was lost in the model after adjustment for albumin
   level. Only albumin level determined mortality (p=0.03). Discussion:
   Lower potassium level was associated with all-cause mortality, but only
   as a confounding effect of malnutrition in dialysis patients
   Objectives: A new method to adhere biological tissue to another or to
   metal such as stainless steel using integrated low-level energy sources,
   heat, pressure, and vibration is proposed. Methods: Heat, pressure, and
   vibration are simultaneously delivered by pressing the porcine aorta
   tissues on the vibration plate with the heated tip. Tensile tests on
   adhered specimens were performed to determine adhesion characteristics
   to adhesion temperature, time, pressure, and vibration. The effect of
   metal surface coating, fluorine-doped DLC coating, on the adhesion
   strength was examined. In one application, the inlet port of a
   ventricular assist device adhered to a porcine ventricle muscle by
   applying the novel method with a temperature of 80 degrees Centigrade
   for 120 seconds. Sufficient adhesion was observed without additional
   vibration. In a second application, the vessel adhesion apparatus was
   developed to connect a bypass graft to a coronary artery. The device has
   both a heating and pressurizing part on the tip, which was used to
   attach the bypass graft to the coronary artery by applying heat with a
   temperature of 120 degrees Centigrade for 120 seconds. Results and
   Discussion: The maximal shear tensile strength using the proposed novel
   adhesion method was 200 kPa, which is half the strength of the porcine
   aorta. Adhesion strength increased in proportion to temperature, time,
   and pressure. The adhesion strength can be controlled by surface
   treatment of metals. In the first application, the inlet port adhered to
   the ventricle muscle with a shear tensile strength of 91 kPa, which is
   enough to keep the pump attached to the ventricle. In the second
   application, the bypass graft adhered to the coronary artery with a
   shear tensile strength of 50 kPa, which is sufficient to maintain
   attachment when exposed to normal blood pressure. The proposed adhesion
   method indicates satisfactory performance.
   Objectives: The requirements for safety and efficacy of medical devices
   are constantly increasing leading to higher costs and time to market.
   Simulations are proving to be particularly promising in accelerating the
   approval process and at the same time further increasing patient safety.
   The FDA related Medical Device Innovation Consortium predicts that in
   some years about 40\% of the evidences for regulatory approval are
   coming from virtual patients and simulations. What is the status today
   and how do we get there? Methods: Simulations can improve the regulatory
   assessment in various phases of the product life cycle, e.g. to justify
   design adjustments, worst-case estimates of sizes and variants,
   definition of test loads for experiments, to perform virtual tests on a
   large number of patients/conditions or to identify the root cause of
   failure. This may especially be important in consideration of the future
   requirements of the MDR for patient-specific implants. Results: So far,
   the use of simulations was hindered by a lack of guidance and
   expectations within the medical device community. However, today the FDA
   and ASME are strongly supporting the use of this approach with new
   guidelines (guidance 1807) and a V\&V standard (V\&V40). ``FDA's Office
   of Science and Engineering Laboratories has committed significant
   resources for transforming computational modeling from a valuable
   scientific tool to a valuable regulatory tool because of its potential
   for significant cost-savings in evaluating medical devices, simulating
   performance under scenarios that may not be possible with human use or
   that could more effectively be evaluated with simulation.{''}
   Discussion: Computer-aided simulations have the potential to
   revolutionize the field of regulatory approval. However, it is crucial
   that the simulations are performed with care and its limitations are
   understood. To foster confidence and wider acceptance of in silico
   methods, a proper methodology is needed to ensure appropriate
   credibility.
   Objectives: TAVI is the treatment of severe aortic valve stenosis in
   elderly patients or in patients with too high risk for conventional
   surgery. CT-scan is mandatory for valve sizing. It requires injection of
   contrast medium that may cause or increase kidney failure. The study aim
   was to establish the accuracy of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), a no
   contrast medium technique, for measurements of native aortic valve in
   patients undergoing TAVI. Values by IVUS were compared to CT-scan ones
   in the same patients. Methods: From June 2014 to January 2019 137
   consecutive patients (74 M, mean age 82.7 +/- 5.6 years) (Logistic
   EuroSCORE 22.7 +/- 14.9\%; STS score mortality 21.3 +/- 13.7\%)
   undergoing TAVI through femoral access were enrolled. Each patient had
   high resolution angio-CT for these measurements: diameter, perimeter,
   and area of the aortic annulus. In all patients, during procedure and
   before prosthetic valve implantation, a manual IVUS pullback, from left
   ventricular outflow tract to ascending aorta, was performed by 7F IVUS
   probe. On the recorded IVUS pullback, a second operator blind to CT
   measures sized minimum and maximum diameter, perimeter and area of the
   aortic annulus. In order to assess inter-rater concordance and agreement
   between CT and IVUS data, Bland-Altman analysis and Pearson's
   correlation were applied. A p value Results: A very strong correlation
   was found between the measures. Maximum diameter: CT 2.5 +/- 0.3 vs IVUS
   2.6 +/- 0.3 cm; r=+0.985; pDiscussion: These results prove the accuracy
   and reliability of aortic annulus measurements by IVUS compared to those
   by CT-scan. Sizing of the aortic annulus by IVUS only may be considered
   in patients likely to develop kidney failure due to contrast medium
   injection.
   Objectives: The long-term usage of rotary blood pumps is limited by the
   high amount of blood damage, which leads to a high number of adverse
   events. Most of the blood damage is generated in the gap between the
   rotor blades and the housing wall, the area with the highest stress load
   and very short exposure times. The damage is caused by both shear and
   normal forces on the blood components. The objective is to investigate
   the blood damage in this region by examining different gap geometries.
   The focus is the damage caused by high dynamic normal stresses and the
   comparison with the blood damage models. Methods: A section of the blade
   gap of an axial rotary blood pump was reconstructed on a microchannel
   chip, which is sealed with siliconized cover glasses. In additional
   channels the inlet and outlet rounding are varied between 0.05 and 0.6
   mm. The gap length and width are kept the same for all channels. A
   channel without a blade gap is integrated to determine the damage caused
   by the test stand. Flow simulations are carried out to determine the
   occurring stresses. The test stand consists of a syringe pump that
   transports 20 mL of human blood back and forth through the microchannels
   for up to 6 hours. Hemolysis is measured every half hour. Results: With
   the test stand it is possible to investigate the influence of different
   gap geometries on the blood damage under controlled conditions. The
   experiments demonstrated the influence of different inlet and outlet
   geometries on the hemolysis. The measured hemolysis was compared with
   the damage models. Discussion: With the test stand it is possible to
   simulate the stress loads in blade gaps on human blood. The influence of
   the high dynamic normal stresses on hemolysis can also be determined
   through variations of the inlet and outlet. It is therefore a
   well-suited tool for improving the corresponding damage models in the
   area of high dynamic stress loads. The findings allow the optimization
   of the region to further reduce blood damage caused by rotary blood
   pumps.
   Objectives: Cardiac grafts produced by combining human pluripotent stem
   cell (hPSC)-derivatives and tissue engineering are a promising
   therapeutic option for the replacement of cardiomyocytes (CM) lost due
   to myocardial infarction. Currently, the vascularization and maturation
   of such grafts are the most critical aspects. In addition to endothelial
   cells (EC), pericytes (PC) are known to play a crucial role in vessel
   development and stabilization. Methods: Here, an hPSC-derived PC
   differentiation protocol is shown as well as an in vitro model for the
   investigation of the role of PCs in hPSC-derived bioartificial cardiac
   tissues (BCT). Results: In the established differentiation protocol, the
   population giving rise to PCs (CD31-/PDGFR beta+) represented up to 94\%
   of all cells and could be further purified via cell sorting. The
   obtained hPSC-PCs exhibited functional characteristics of PCs in
   co-culture assays, and showed similar gene expression profile to primary
   PCs. Differentiated hPSC-PCs were used w/ or w/o purified hPSC-ECs to
   generate BCTs and to address their effect on tissue morphology,
   metabolism, and electrophysiological parameters compared to control
   tissues containing primary fibroblasts (Fb). Interestingly, tissues with
   hPSC-PCs exhibited equivalent contraction forces compared to controls,
   but more organized sarcomere structures as well as improved longitudinal
   cell- and extracellular matrix orientation. Furthermore, the beating
   frequency and passive forces showed native-like values. Addition of
   hPSC-ECs resulted in spontaneously formed and maintained endothelial
   network structures, which were distributed throughout the BCTs and the
   involvement of PCs in such structures was demonstrated. Discussion: The
   characterized and functional hPSC-PCs together with hPSC-derived CMs and
   ECs represent a promising cell source for myocardial tissue replacement
   therapy. Their dual ability in supporting EC function and matrix
   remodeling during tissue maturation makes them a favorable candidate to
   replace primary Fbs.
   Objectives: High prevalence of thrombi around the Left Ventricular
   Assist Device (LVAD) cannula has been proven by pathological studies.
   Thrombogenic potential (TP) inside of the left ventricle (LV) is
   evaluated based on shear stress history (SSH) and residence time (RT) of
   particles; however, the effect of the atrial inflow - including rotation
   and uneven flow distribution of the pulmonary veins - is ignored. In
   this study, the influence of the atrial inflow on the TP was
   investigated via Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.
   Methods: In a patient-specific left ventricle (LV) model under full LVAD
   support, the flow fields were simulated with three different inflow
   conditions: with perpendicular velocity to the inflow (LAper, flow rate:
   3.5l/min), with an additional rotational component at the inflow (LArot:
   35rpm) and with asymmetric inflow conditions (LAasym: 60\%/40\%
   left/right). Platelet motion was simulated with a combination of laminar
   and the Lagrangian methods for 7s. The TP value was calculated based on
   the RT and SSH of particles (0<TP<1, with higher values corresponding to
   higher risk). Results: The ventricular flow patterns were comparable for
   perpendicular and rotational inflows and different for asymmetric
   conditions. TP values were different for each of the atrial inflow
   conditions (LAasym: 0.37, LArot: 0.35, LAper: 0.4). The number of the
   particles with a SSH value more than 0.6 Pa center dot s (non-outlier
   range) increased for LAasym simulation (LAasym: 11\%, LArot: 5\%, LAper:
   3\%;p<0.05); however the particles that remain for more than 7s inside
   the LV were higher for LAper simulation (LAasym: 13\%, LArot: 18\%,
   LAper: 19\%;p<0.05). Discussion: CFD is an advanced tool for the
   evaluation of ventricular flow during LVAD support; however, neglecting
   the atrial inflow conditions could lead to an inaccurate prediction of
   flow parameters linked to ventricular and pump thrombosis. Reliable
   evaluation of ventricular blood flow, therefore, requires the
   consideration of realistic atrial inflow conditions.
   Objectives: Thrombus formation is a major risk of implants with
   artificial materials in blood contact. This adhesion of blood platelets
   plays an important role in thrombus formation and is influenced by the
   electrochemical conditions of the surface. The objective of this
   research is to change the electrochemical conditions by applying a low
   voltage, high frequency alternating electrical current to the surface,
   in order to avoid the adhesion of the platelets involved in thrombus
   formation. Methods: Thin sheet samples with a thickness of 0.5 mm from
   different materials (titanium, stainless steel and copper) are attached
   to a high frequency generator and exposed to human whole blood under
   controlled flow conditions in an in vitro setting. An electrical current
   ranging from 50 mu A until 400 mu A in a frequency range from 10 kHz to
   100 kHz was applied. The deposition of the blood platelets on the
   surface is identified and quantified by using fluorescent microscopy and
   digital image processing. The thrombus formation and therefore the
   anti-thrombogenic effect of the method is investigated in respect to
   different generator settings for each material. Results: The
   characterization of all materials revealed changes of the surfaces in
   comparison to the zero samples. A differently pronounced reduction of
   thrombus formation with the proposed anti-thrombogenic method could be
   demonstrated on all three materials. Discussion: Though the method could
   improve the anti-thrombogenicity under certain conditions, the mechanism
   is not fully understood yet and the parameters are not optimized.
   Further investigations will also focus on possible side effects caused
   by potential structural changes of blood proteins.
   Objectives: Cationic liposomes OO4 (N-\{6-amino-1-{[}N-(9Z)
   -octadec9-enylamino] -1-oxohexan-(2S) -2-yl\} -N0- \{2- {[}N,
   N-bis(2-aminoethyl) amino] ethyl\} -2-hexadecylpropandiamide) and DOPE
   contain a higher amount of amino groups than classical lipids. A
   polyelectrolyte multilayer system (PEM) made of chondroitin sulphate
   (CS) and collagen type I (COL I) was prepared by Layer-by-Layer
   technique with liposomes embedded in the terminal layers for the
   controlled release of components to promote osteogenic differentiation
   for bone regeneration. Methods: Characterization of the PEM was
   performed using ellipsometry. This technique was used to investigate the
   thickness on substrate coated with PEM of CS, liposomes, COL I as
   terminal layer. The layer growth behavior of PEM was studied using
   Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The cell adhesion of C2C12 cells and
   the cellular uptake efficiency of the liposomes embedded onto PEM was
   evaluated using fluorescence staining and flow cytometry. Results: The
   SPR results showed a linear growth with an increase in the angle shift
   corresponding to the adsorbed mass of PEM. The increase in thickness
   after liposome adsorption was significant. The cell studies indicated
   that cells seeded on terminal liposome layer showed a higher amount of
   cells on the surface. The population of cells that took up liposomes are
   higher in the absence of serum than in medium with FBS. Discussion: The
   quantification of liposome uptake indicated that the population of cells
   that took up liposomes were higher in the absence of serum. The results
   showed the uptake efficiency of cationic liposomes embedded onto a PEM
   system for controlled release of hydrophobic and hydrophilic models
   compounds into the cells.
   Objectives: Many different tissue sealants are available on the market.
   BioGlue tissue sealants are produced by a bovine serum albumin treated
   intra-operatively with glutaraldehyde. Here we report a sterile
   peri-graft abscess formation, possibly caused as a reaction to the
   liberal use of BioGlue. Methods: A-54 years-old male patient underwent
   ascending aortic and hemiarch replacement for acute type A aortic
   dissection. Exceptionally, the anastomotic suture line was reinforced by
   application of BioGlue tissue sealant. The initial post-operative course
   was uneventful. After transfer to the general ward on day four the
   patient developed fever and an inflammatory syndrome. A broad spectrum
   antibiotherapy was started for a suspicion of pneumonia. In the
   following chest CT scan a suspicious peri-graft fluid collection was
   present. The patient underwent a surgical revision for acute
   mediastinitis rule out. During the procedure a whitish-milky liquid was
   found that differed macroscopically from a classical abscess. The chest
   was left open with a negative-pressure wound dressing. The patient
   became apyretic and the inflammatory markers normalized. After a one
   week follow-up with negative cultures and 3 consecutive dressing
   changes, the chest was closed and recovery uneventful. The patient was
   discharged to an outside hospital at six post-operative days. Results:
   All the samples which were analysed histologically and for different
   pathologic stains as well as and by broad spectrum culture analysis,
   remained negative throughout. At one month follow-up the patient
   remained well and without fever or inflammatory response. Discussion:
   Although several published case reports about tissue necrosis and
   anastomotic rupture following BioGlue use, the formation of a sterile
   abscess is a rare complication. In this patient, the peri-graft effusion
   might have been an allergy like inflammatory response to the bovine
   albumin within BioGlue. A prolonged postoperative mediastinal drainage
   when using BioGlue might prevent this rare complication.
   Objectives: The use of loop diuretics like furosemide is discussed in
   intensive care medicine regarding their clinical efficacy and safety.
   The hypothesis arose whether both parameters depend on the capability of
   serum albumin to transfer the drug to the kidneys. Methods: Serial blood
   \& urine samples were taken from intensive care patients receiving
   furosemide infusions for volume overload. Free furosemide serum
   fractions \& urine concentrations were determined by HPLC/LCMS. Albumin
   binding capacity (ABiC) was quantified by adding a binding site II
   (diazepam binding site) specific fluorescence marker (Dansylsarcosine,
   DS). The amount of unbound DS was detected by fluorescence analysis
   after ultrafiltration, corresponding with ABiC. Results: 62 patients
   were assessed. 50 patients (30male, 67,5 +/- 10,3 years) were included
   into statistical analysis. Main reasons for intensive care admission
   were sepsis (n=18) and perioperative care. Indications for furosemide
   were volume overload in acute or acute on chronic kidney injury (n=42),
   volume management in sepsis, ARDS or lung edema (n=8). ABiC was reduced
   to 65,2+/-12,2\%, The free furosemide fraction (normal <5\%) correlated
   negatively with ABiC (r -0,638, p<0,001) with 15,76+/-11,52\% in those
   with ABIC<60\% and 5,36+/-5,29\% in ABiC 60\% (p<0,001). The urinary
   fraction of furosemide (normal >65\%) was significantly lower in those
   with ABiC <60\% as compared to 60\% (7,47+/-5,83\% vs. 23,98+/-17,91,
   p<0,01). Furosemide induced increase in urine output was strongly
   correlated with ABiC (r=0,908, p<0,017). Discussion: Our results
   indicate a role of ABiC in the pharmacokinetics of furosemide, impacting
   its free serum fraction and urinary fraction. Data are suggestive for a
   link between status of the albumin-dependend drug carrier mechanism and
   the safety and efficacy of the drug. Clinicians will profit from our
   results regarding safe use of loop diuretics \& furosemide
   responsiveness in patients with volume overload and kidney injury.
   Objectives: Albumin is a blood protein with various physiological
   functions as there are: maintenance of osmotic pressure, antioxidant and
   transport function for endogenous and exogenous ligands. Binding of
   these ligands can affect conformational changes of human serum albumin.
   Methods: The ``Albumin-functionality-test{''} is based on EPR
   spectroscopy and detects modified binding and functional
   characteristics. The used radical supporting spin probe binds analogous
   ligands variably strong at different albumin binding sites and thus,
   serves as an indirect marker for serum albumin functionality with regard
   to its ability for binding, transport and detoxification. A comparison
   of three different mixtures of albumin and a spin-labeled fatty acid
   allows for the in vitro simulation of binding-, transport- and
   release-conditions by the Albumin-functionality-test. Thus, an
   ``effective{''} albumin concentration could be determined. It quantifies
   the amount of functional albumin in the patient in comparison to healthy
   controls. Results: We applied Albumin-functionality-test to albumin
   preparations differing in redox state of cysteine-34, namely human
   mercaptalbumin (HMA), human non-mercaptalbumin1 (HNA1) and human
   non-mercaptalbumin2 (HNA2) and found differences in their functionality.
   The analysis of samples from patients with different states of liver
   failure showed a strong correlation of binding efficiency and
   detoxification efficiency, depending on the severity of the disease.
   Discussion: Due to the increasing numbers of studies using commercial
   albumin preparations for the treatment of patients with liver disease,
   we investigated different available albumin samples regarding their
   albumin functionality. We found dramatically reduced binding and
   detoxification efficiencies. Our findings might be used for patient
   selection and prognoses for personalized therapies. Taken together,
   these results might affect the importance of albumin from the patient
   view and refer to its stability as a drug.
   Objectives: The analysis of Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) power
   is a commonly used method to identify complications such as pump
   thrombosis. However, the LVAD power is also affected by different
   influences like the circadian rhythm. To optimize our thrombosis
   detection algorithm, we analyzed LVAD log files. Methods: For the
   investigation of power behavior in LVAD log files, we retrospectively
   analyzed 840 log files from 189 patients. Each patient received an HVAD
   (HeartWare). The log files contain on average 3000 power values
   collected over a period of appx. 31 days. None of the analyzed log files
   contained serious complications, such as a pump thrombosis. Results: To
   show a significant difference between the power values of the daytime (8
   am-10 pm) and the night-time, a statistical test (significance level:
   5\%) was carried out. 813 of 840 log files showed a significant
   difference (average t = 16.94). In addition, the average difference
   between the maximum and the minimum power value of a day was calculated
   for each day (average: 1071.9mW, SD: 158.2mW, range: 497.1mW -
   2299.5mW). Furthermore, the average power was calculated for each day
   and log file. To get a measure for the fluctuation in daily average of
   power development within a log file, the SD has been calculated (SD
   average: 65.3mW, range 10.4mW - 435.9mW). Discussion: The retrospective
   analysis of LVAD log files shows that power behavior is individual.
   Although most patients show a significant power difference between
   daytime and night-time hours, the maximum difference of a day and the
   average power changes over several days varies from patient to patient.
   A patient-specific power model, considering the circadian rhythm, was
   developed and applied to our thrombosis detection algorithms, which
   achieved a better thrombosis detection time of up to 93 hours compared
   to the LVAD controller alarming algorithm.
   Objectives: Suppression of membrane fouling is an important key
   technology for the development of portable and implantable artificial
   kidneys. Among several factors known to affect membrane fouling, we
   focused on the blood flow condition. In the present study, to clarify
   the effect of pulsatile and non-pulsatile blood flow on membrane
   fouling, an ex vivo hemofiltration experiment using porcine blood was
   carried out. Methods: Hemofiltration with filtrate recycling was
   performed under three conditions; pulsatile flow using a roller pump,
   non-pulsatile flow using a roller pump with three chambers to stabilize
   the flow, and non-pulsatile flow using a centrifugal pump. The blood
   flow rate (QB) was set at 50 or 100 mL/min and the maximum filtration
   rate at which irreversible membrane fouling would not occur was
   determined as follows; the first filtration rate (QF) was set at 2.5\%
   of the QB for one hour (baseline), increased by 2.5\% to 5\% of the QB
   for one hour, and then returned to the baseline value for 20 min, and
   the transmembrane pressure (TMP) was measured to check if it had
   returned to the baseline value. This step was repeated until the QF
   reached 25\% of the QB. Results: For both blood flow rates (50 and 100
   mL/min), the maximum filtration flow rate at which the TMP did not
   return to the baseline, implying that irreversible membrane fouling had
   occurred, was higher under the non-pulsatile flow conditions than under
   the pulsatile flow condition. Discussion: The flow rate and the TMP
   changed periodically under the pulsatile flow condition and the peak TMP
   value was higher than that under the non-pulsatile flow condition, which
   increases the burden on the membrane. Thus, there is an increased
   likelihood of membrane fouling, as compared to the constant the pressure
   under the non-pulsatile flow condition.
   Objectives: The objective is to develop a simulator of the anatomy and
   hemodynamics of the radial artery in order to design a robust controller
   for a noninvasive, continuous blood pressure measurement method.
   Currently, blood pressure, in intensive care units, is measured
   invasively, which can lead to complications (e.g. infections). The novel
   approach facilitates a continuous noninvasive flow measurement, in
   addition to the instantaneous blood pressure measurement. Methods:
   During measurements, a controller pneumatically adjusts the pressure in
   a balloon, positioned on top of the radial artery, so that the Doppler
   derived flow in the radial artery is reduced to a constant target value.
   The resulting pressure in the balloon correlates with the blood
   pressure. For the development of this method, a simulator, modelling the
   anatomical conditions of the lower arm, was constructed. The simulator
   was designed to create arbitrary physiological pressure curves. For the
   validation of the simulator, invasively measured blood pressure curves
   and data found in literature related to the mass flow rates were
   compared to the curves created by the simulator. Results: The pressure
   curve, created with the simulator, shows a deviation of less than 5 \%
   to the invasively measured blood pressure. The mass flow rate shows a
   good agreement with the literature data. The simulator is capable of
   simulating blood pressure curves with a mean arterial pressure of 40
   mmHg to 120 mmHg. First tests with the controller have shown that it is
   possible to control the pulsatile flow to the constant target flow rate.
   Discussion: Regarding the simulator, the next step is to adjust it, so
   that it can simulate flows above a mean pressure of 120 mmHg. Regarding
   the controller, stress tests must be conducted. It must be evaluated
   whether it is robust enough to work with pressure curves that fluctuate
   in mean pressure and frequency.
   Objectives: Relative blood volume (RBV) changes during haemodialysis are
   typically estimated from variations in haematocrit, haemoglobin or total
   blood protein measured by optical, acoustic or other sensors integrated
   in the dialysis circuit. Due to dynamic changes in the circulation
   during the initial phase of dialysis (following filling of the
   extracorporeal circuit with the patient's blood and starting dialyzer
   ultrafiltration), the indications of RBV monitors depend on the exact
   moment of starting RBV measurements. The aim of this study was to assess
   this issue quantitatively using a mathematical modelling approach.
   Methods: The developed compartmental model describes the flow of blood
   across the cardiovascular system and the extracorporeal circuit combined
   with the whole-body transport of water and the most important
   osmotically active solutes and the baroreflex mechanisms. The model was
   validated using clinical data from patients on maintenance HD. A
   standard 4-hour HD session with 3 L ultrafiltration was studied for a
   virtual reference patient with all model parameters based on the
   literature data. RBV changes were derived from the simulated haematocrit
   (HCT) changes. Two cases were analysed: the priming saline being infused
   to the patient or discarded. Results: For the case when the priming
   saline was infused to the patient, the total RBV reduction at the end of
   the simulated dialysis session varied between 8 \% (when HCT changes
   were monitored from the very beginning of dialysis) and 13 \% (when HCT
   monitoring was started circa 4 minutes later). For the case when the
   priming saline was discarded, the analogous difference in RBV reduction
   was less than 1 percentage point. Discussion: When the priming saline is
   infused to the patient, a few minute difference in the moment of
   starting RBV measurements may significantly affect the indicated RBV
   changes, which is due to the dilution of blood by the infused saline and
   the time it takes for the uniform mixing of blood across the circulatory
   system.
   We have developed autologous in vivo tissue engineered vascular grafts
   (in vivo TEVG, i.e. BIOTUBE) mainly composed of fibroblasts and collagen
   constructed in the patients' subcutaneous tissues. After long term
   animal experiments over 5 years, we clinically applied them to the
   congenital heart surgery of a 2-year-old child as a pulmonary artery
   patch plasty material in 2015. Three years after implantation, 3D-CT
   exhibited neither aneurysmal dilatation, significant calcification, nor
   shrinkage of the patch graft interfering the growth of the pulmonary
   artery. The clinical course was good without any significant
   complications over 4 years presently. However, since the tissue
   formation largely depends on the regenerative ability of the host,
   individual differences exist, and it is an issue to secure the
   mechanical reliability of the grafts formed in high-risk patients. We
   are currently evaluating the changes in mechanical properties of TEVGs
   by chemical treatment, and are examining whether it is possible to
   improve mechanical durability. In addition, in order to fabricate the
   TEVGs in healthy individuals as allogeneic (parents) or xenogeneic
   tissue substitutes, we are conducting transplantation experiments on
   decellularized tissues. The in vivo TEVGs could also be applied to
   AV-shunts. However, in the animal pilot experiments, significant
   stenosis was observed at the anastomosis with host vein resulting in
   early occlusion probably because of high sheer stresses. The attempts to
   overcome the problems by several investigators are also reviewed.
   Objectives: To evaluate different designs or insertion techniques of
   cochlear implant electrode carriers (ECs) insertion forces are measured
   by a force sensor, which is mounted directly underneath an artificial
   cochlea model (aCM) leading to a summed force profile. One of the next
   steps in CI research leads from post-experimental evaluation of measured
   insertion force profiles to pre-experimental predictions of these
   profiles using analytical models based on an improved knowledge about
   factors impacting the insertion forces. Three likely factors were chosen
   for further investigation: speed, EC stiffness and curvature of the aCM.
   Methods: Three aCM were fabricated out of PTFE blocks, each model having
   one constant curvature (r = 6.4 / 8.5 / 12.7 mm). Additionally EC
   substitutes were fabricated using a two-component silicone, all with a
   constant diameter (0.7 mm), a total length of 20.5 mm and embedded bare
   copper wires. In order to vary the stiffness of the EC substitutes, one
   type had four and the other six wires embedded. They were inserted into
   the aCM with three different insertion speeds ( v = 0.11 / 0.4 / 1.6
   mm/s). In order to increase reproducibility, insertions were conducted
   using an automated insertion test bench, comprising a linear actuator to
   clamp the EC substitutes and move them into the aCM and the force sensor
   underneath the model. Results: In accordance with theoretical
   considerations all varied factors showed effects on the insertion force
   profiles. Increased insertion speed and sample stiffness increased the
   insertion forces, whereas an increased model radius decreased the
   insertion forces. Discussion: The variance of measured forces within one
   set of parameters is due to the manual fabrication of samples and may be
   decreased by usage of commercial ECs. The influence of lubricants has to
   be analysed within future experiments.
   Objectives: The purpose of this work is to design and create a high
   efficiency inductive powering unit (IPU) for a wide range of implantable
   devices and artificial organs (AO). Methods: A possible way to realize
   wireless powering is to use inductive energy transfer systems. To
   maximize overall system efficiency class E power amplifier is widely
   used due to its 100\% efficiency in the ideal case. But maximum
   efficiency can be achieved only if input and output system parameters
   will remain constant during IPU operation. Inductive coils have nonzero
   distance between them because of patient's tissue thickness. It is worth
   noting that tissue thickness is different for every patient: the
   difference may be several millimeters. Moreover, this value can change
   during IPU operation as a result of patient's motor activity or tissue
   edema which will lead to PA detuning and decreasing efficiency. To avoid
   PA's detuning, frequency tuning systems can be used. There are two
   approaches for tuning systems that can be found in the literature. The
   first uses voltage and/or current levels of important circuit nodes to
   estimate system status. This method is good and quite simple, but
   requires external control signals that means additional power losses and
   decreased efficiency. The other method uses the phase of the voltage
   signals from important nodes and consumes less power. The second method
   was chosen by authors to design a tuning system. Results: During this
   work, a calculation method for PA and the frequency tuning system were
   designed. The experimental prototype was created. The authors of this
   article obtained an overall system efficiency of more than 60 \% for
   three different coil sets and output power from 0.7 W to 1 W for same
   coil sets and range of axial misalignments from 10 to 20 mm. Discussion:
   The high efficiency inductive powering system for AO has been designed
   and tested during this work.
   Objectives: Native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular
   access for hemodialysis (HD), but it still fails in more than 40\% cases
   within the first year. Stenosis is the main cause of AVF failure, but
   its detection and prediction are still open clinical challenges. The
   purpose of our study was to explore the potential of using sound
   analysis to reveal unique characteristics in AVF sounds and to detect
   potentially relevant changes over time. Methods: We acquired the sounds
   of 10 AVFs, 7 referred by the nephrologists as well-functioning and 3 as
   stenotic AVFs. We also acquired the sound of 1 AVF characterized by
   severe stenosis and we repeated the recording after surgical revision.
   Sounds were recorded using the Littmann Electronic Stethoscope 3200
   using wide mode. Sounds were transmitted via Bluetooth to a laptop and
   frequency spectra were obtained using an in-house Matlab code embedding
   the Fast Fourier Transform and a high-pass filter with a cutoff
   frequency of 50 Hz, aimed at attenuating stethoscope's noise and heart
   sounds' frequencies. Results: In well-functioning AVFs we consistently
   found a low-frequency peak, located in the bandwidth 100-200 Hz, while
   no relevant spectral features were present at higher frequencies. On the
   other hand, stenotic AVFs showed high-frequency peaks, located in the
   bandwidth of 500-600 Hz. In the AVF with severe stenosis we found
   high-frequency peaks in the bandwidth 700-750 Hz, which were replaced by
   low-frequency peaks after AVF revision. Discussion: Sound analysis
   revealed unique characteristics in the frequency spectra of AVFs,
   allowing an objective discrimination between well-functioning and
   stenotic AVFs. This technique may bring the advantage of limiting
   clinician's skill-dependency and personal interpretation. Despite being
   preliminary, our results suggest that sound analysis may be used to
   detect stenosis development and allow patients' self-monitoring,
   resulting in early prediction of AVF failure.
   Objectives: Biofilms on percutaneous leads of implanted blood pumps can
   cause severe infections. By treating infections with antibiotics over a
   long period of time, bacteria develop resistance. Today, in a clinical
   setting, antibiotic resistance is determined in-vitro for all available
   drugs. The aim of the EvolChip project is to predict the probabilities
   of resistances that might evolve and suggest combinations of antibiotics
   that slow down or even prevent future resistance. Methods: The EvolChip
   reactor consists of an agar plate that serves as a diffusion and growth
   medium. Three membranes permit diffusion of active substances from
   microfluidic channels into the agar medium. Two of these channels serve
   as sources for different antibiotics, the third one as the sink. As a
   result, two overlapping drug gradients establish, with a low
   concentration near the sink and high concentration close to the sources.
   Antibiotics were mixed with a nutrient solution to promote bacteria
   migration towards higher concentrated areas. The bacteria contain a
   green fluorescent protein gene, which enables real-time tracking via
   polarisation filters and a camera. Results: In preliminary experiments,
   the gradient course could be characterized by making use of fluorescent
   markers. Only resistant bacteria migrated towards the sources with high
   antibiotic concentration. The spatial distribution of bacteria
   facilitates the identification of optimal concentration ratios and
   mixtures of antibiotics. In addition, the speed of resistance evolution
   with respect to different antibiotic mixtures was determined.
   Discussion: The proposed EvolChip concept showed promising results in
   preliminary experiments. Further geometries, growth media, and bacteria
   will be tested. In order to validate the method, patient strains with
   known treatment and resistance history will be compared to the
   predictions of the presented method.
   Objectives: Due to the growing demand for organs in liver
   transplantation, techniques for optimization of suboptimal livers are
   needed such as normotermic liver perfusion (PNT). In this way, hepatic
   repercussion of ischaemic preconditioning (PI) still remains unclear.
   This study aims to analyze the haemodynamic and biochemical alterations
   produced after intraoperative PI on livers subjected to 6 hours of PNT.
   As a secondary objective, we aim to determine the effect of PI on liver
   function. Methods: Eight minipig livers, randomized to control (n=4) and
   PI group (n=4), were perfused during six hours in a PNT circuit (34oC).
   The PI group was subjected to 10 minutes of ischaemia by means of a
   Pringle manoeuvrein the hepatic hilum, followed by 10 minutes of
   reperfusion. Biochemical and gasometric parameters were measured at
   baseline and hourly in perfusate. Pressures and flows in hepatic artery
   (HA) and portal vein (PV) were registered. For statistical analysis
   Spearman's rho test and Mann-Whitney U test was performed, considering p
   < 0,05 as significant. Results: There were significant differences in HA
   flow, adjusted to weight, doubling the control group (PI 0,42 +/- 0,17
   ml/min/g Vs GC 0,17 +/- 0,05 ml/min/g; p=0,000); no differences were
   found in PV flow. Total proteins (PI 1,9 {[}1,7-2]g/dL Vs GC 1,3
   {[}0,95-1,5]g/dL; p=0,000) and O-2 consumption rate (PI 0,086
   {[}0,055-0,113] ml/min/g Vs GC 0,040 {[}0,017-0,060]ml/min/g;
   p=0,000)were significantly increased in the PI group. There were no
   significant differences in AST, ALT, or GGT. Discussion: The PI, as a
   previous maneuver to PNT, increases hepatic artery flow and O2
   consumption without altering citolytic parameters in liver. This may
   improve hepatic functionality as a previous step in transplantation.
   Further molecular and histological study should be made to clarify our
   finding in PI on PNT.}},

Title = {{Applying augmented reality in physical education on motor skills
   learning}},
Journal = {{INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS}},
Abstract = {{Physical education is a course that integrates knowledge of sports with
   skill drilling. Augmented Reality (AR)-assisted instruction has
   infrequently been applied in sport skill drilling. Video-assisted
   instruction has frequently applied to physical sports; however, it
   neither involves interactive practice nor embodies both textbook
   learning and the practice of sporting skills simultaneously. As a
   complement to video-assisted instruction, AR can apply virtual messages
   to learning objects so that 3-dimensional models can be superimposed
   into textbooks, which allows learners to read books while operating 3D
   character models. To verify the effects of learning outcomes, motor
   skills, and learning motivation with AR-assisted instruction and the
   effects of different difficulty levels on instruction materials, two
   experimental studies were implemented. Simple and basic running actions
   and more difficult Mark exercise actions were chosen as the teaching
   content. The experiments adopted a quasi-experimental design. The
   findings indicate that AR-assisted instruction is more effective than
   video-assisted instruction, and the effects are better for more
   difficult motor skills learning.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time multimedia applications, such as interactive gaming, live
   video streaming, and augmented reality, have strict latency and bitrate
   requirements. However, unpredictable network conditions, such as
   congestion and link quality, can severely degrade the quality of
   experience (QoE). While buffer-based mitigations cannot he applied to
   real-time applications due to their immediate resource needs, recent
   innovations in network slicing have demonstrated the feasibility of
   dedicating specified amounts of network resources to individual sessions
   in the radio access network. Encouraged by this, we propose to reserve
   network resources for multimedia sessions in real time according to
   their declared needs, thereby providing ad hoc session-level performance
   guarantees. Through Wi-Fi experiments and trace-driven LTE simulations,
   we show that such session-level resource provisioning is robust to
   real-time channel fluctuations and congestion externalities over the
   lifetime of a session. This approach, however, raises challenges: how
   can the network ensure that users are honest about their resource needs
   and optimally allocate its limited resources to users under uncertainty
   in future sessions' resource needs? We derive a novel multi-unit
   combinatorial auction (MUCA) model with a unique structure that can be
   exploited for fast winner determination, and yet incentivize truthful
   bidding, properties not simultaneously achieved in a generic MUCA but
   essential to making real-time session guarantees. Furthermore, since
   dynamic bidding in real time is challenging for end-users who are
   budget-constrained, we develop a reinforcement learning-based
   utility-maximizing strategy to distribute their budget across sessions
   and show that it yields high user utility.}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to investigate the Grand Challenges which arise in the
   current and emerging landscape of rapid technological evolution towards
   more intelligent interactive technologies, coupled with increased and
   widened societal needs, as well as individual and collective
   expectations that HCI, as a discipline, is called upon to address. A
   perspective oriented to humane and social values is adopted, formulating
   the challenges in terms of the impact of emerging intelligent
   interactive technologies on human life both at the individual and
   societal levels. Seven Grand Challenges are identified and presented in
   this article: Human-Technology Symbiosis; Human-Environment
   Interactions; Ethics, Privacy and Security; Well-being, Health and
   Eudaimonia; Accessibility and Universal Access; Learning and Creativity;
   and Social Organization and Democracy. Although not exhaustive, they
   summarize the views and research priorities of an international
   interdisciplinary group of experts, reflecting different scientific
   perspectives, methodological approaches and application domains. Each
   identified Grand Challenge is analyzed in terms of: concept and problem
   definition; main research issues involved and state of the art; and
   associated emerging requirements. BACKGROUND This article presents the
   results of the collective effort of a group of 32 experts involved in
   the community of the Human Computer Interaction International (HCII)
   Conference series. The group's collaboration started in early 2018 with
   the collection of opinions from all group members, each asked to
   independently list and describe five HCI grand challenges. During a
   one-day meeting held on the 20th July 2018 in the context of the HCI
   International 2018 Conference in Las Vegas, USA, the identified topics
   were debated and challenges were formulated in terms of the impact of
   emerging intelligent interactive technologies on human life both at the
   individual and societal levels. Further analysis and consolidation led
   to a set of seven Grand Challenges presented herein. This activity was
   organized and supported by the HCII Conference series.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose MOOCs represent a new concept that offers learning content to
   participants freely, anywhere and anytime. However, they suffer from
   several unsolved problems such as high dropout percentage, low
   completion rate or uncontrollable understanding level of the
   participants that can be caused by the lack of the practical activities
   and simulations. This article aims to propose a solution to ensure the
   integration of virtual manipulations in MOOCs.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes the integration of
   virtual manipulations (simulations and practical activities) relying on
   augmented reality. To ensure the manipulation of the used 3D objects,
   two methods have been proposed based on markers or hand gestures.
   Customized markers are used, facilitating their recognition by the
   users, to visualize the objects and to ensure their interactions. Hand
   gestures have been proposed to perform the manipulation easily.
   Consequently, hand detection and gestures classification using hand
   contour detection and HSV filter have been applied. Findings Two MOOCs
   pedagogically similar were proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   proposed solution. The only difference is that the second MOOC contains
   virtual manipulations that the participants can perform to understand
   better and to interact during the courses. The finding results show that
   the participants' understanding and satisfaction levels in the second
   MOOC were higher, and the dropout rate was lower than the first one.
   Originality/value The integration of practical activities/simulations in
   MOOCs using augmented reality is the key novelty of our work. To do so,
   two manipulation methods have been proposed, so the instructor can feel
   free to choose the adequate method to ensure a better progress of the
   manipulations.}},

Abstract = {{Educational practices are constantly adjusting to technological
   advances, in order to improve their effectiveness in delivering
   knowledge and preparing students for the challenges of modern digital
   society. Electronic games and augmented reality environments are two
   such media that can shape powerful modes of interactive and immersive
   experiences. Audio games in particular, i.e. electronic games that
   utilise data sonification and audio interaction techniques to express
   all narrative and gameplay content, have been proven to enhance players'
   skills, such as concentration, memory, fantasy, emotional response,
   perception, data management and cooperation. However, despite the
   promising research findings reported in literature, there has been no
   systematic approach in integrating systems based on audio interaction
   into formal education. This article suggests that audio games can be
   designed and implemented for the delivery of targeted curricula through
   an engaging learning experience, whereas fusing audio game mechanics
   into new interactive technologies, such as augmented reality
   environments, will further enhance the students' immersiveness in the
   learning process. Towards establishing the theoretical framework for the
   design of educational audio games, as well as educational augmented
   reality audio games, the authors review existing approaches and argue
   that the inherent features of both audio interaction and augmented
   reality systems agree with the official educational goals formulated by
   the Greek Ministry of Education and the International Baccalaureate
   Institution. Then, they discuss four original projects in terms of sound
   and mechanics design to demonstrate that audio games can address a wide
   range of subjects, adopt cross-curricular strategies, facilitate complex
   modes of interaction, and realise creative, collaborative and inclusive
   learning activities.}},

Abstract = {{Assistive technology for children with special needs is a problem that
   is interesting to study. Collaboration between methods and latest
   technology can be used as a learning aid for them. Learning of Hijaiyah
   letters is the first step to being able to read the Holy Qur'an.
   Mentally retarded children have IQs below the average normal child, so
   their learning process is slower and requires special methods. This
   study aims to develop an application by using the Gillingham and
   augmented reality methods to help mentally retarded children recognize
   Hijaiyah letters. The Gillingham method uses a visual, auditory,
   kinestetic, and tactile (VAKT) approach, that can be used to facilitate
   mentally retarded children. While augmented reality is used to develop
   more interesting and interactive applications. Based on the results of
   research and testing, it can be concluded that the learning application
   that was built can improve children's memory and understanding of
   Hijaiyah letters, The results of the pretest and posttest testing,
   showed an increase of 12\% for children who were difficult to receive
   learning material and 6\% for children who are classified as easy to
   receive learning material.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an augmented reality-based multidimensional concept map
   (ARMCM) learning system is proposed for conducting mobile learning

   ARMCM group and a multidimensional concept map (MCM) group. An
   experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach. The experimental results suggested that students in the ARMCM
   group performed significantly better than those in the MCM group.
   Moreover, this study also found that the students using the ARMCM
   learning approach showed significantly higher motivation than those
   using the MCM learning approach, because ARMCM learning is able to
   simulate the complex knowledge that they needed to learn. ARMCM learning
   was easier to understand and easy to use, as it could simplify the
   content of the learning knowledge. Pedagogical implications, conclusion,
   and some suggestions based on this study are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Interactive learning experiences are becoming the standard for today's
   `tech-savvy' generation of students and an important issue for research
   in instructional technology. The design and implementation of higher
   education, incorporating interactive technologies, can be difficult and

   methodology to design interactive learning contents that use recent
   interactive technologies, in particular 360 degrees video, and encourage
   greater student engagement. In this study, 360 degrees videos have been
   designed and implemented in an engineering program but the design
   methodology we suggest can be apply in any industrial or educational
   context. Then, 360 degrees videos have been evaluated by the students as
   highly immersive and engaged environments that surround them and offer
   them an increased sense of presence, giving them a 360-degree view of
   the environment. In this type of video, viewers no longer only look at a
   single screen, they can point the camera lens wherever they want,
   allowing viewers to watch the video from multiple perspectives (active),
   rather than only from the director's point of view (passive).}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, obesity is a serious health problem worldwide. Its occurrence
   has exponentially increased in both children and adults, especially in
   developing countries. Since overweight and obese children are more
   likely to be overweight or obese adults, it is important to control and
   prevent childhood obesity. Moreover, overweight and obesity can put
   children at higher risk for various health problems. Recently, several
   information and communication technology tools have been designed to
   promote good health habits, physical activity, nutrition education, and
   weight loss. Most of these tools, however, target at an adult audience
   and fail to capture the attention of children. To address this gap, we
   present two child-friendly prototypes as nutrition education tools for
   preventing obesity. The prototypes rely on computational techniques such
   as augmented reality and serious games to provide children a more
   user-friendly experience. We also present the designs and evaluation of
   the prototypes and provide key guidelines for developers.}},

Abstract = {{Architectural and civil engineering (ACE) education is inextricably
   connected to real-world practice. The application of augmented reality
   (AR) technology can help to establish a link between virtual and
   real-world information for students. Studies of applying AR in ACE
   education have increased annually, and numerous research have indicated
   that AR possesses immense application potential. To address and analyze
   pertinent research issues, published studies in the Scopus database were
   explored, and revealed that problems persist and are worthy of
   attention, such as the selection of system types and devices, the
   application of research methods, and appropriate learning strategies and
   teaching methods. Courses with objective grading standards should be
   given priority in AR experimental courses for a meticulous investigation
   of AR influence on students' learning outcomes and ultimately
   improvement of classroom quality. Suitable types of AR systems should be
   selected based on course content, prior to the design and development of
   the system. It is recommended to develop markerless systems for a larger
   application range to benefit students with additional convenience.
   Systems can also be accompanied by functions, such as instant online
   assessments, synchronized assessments, and exchange capabilities to
   assist learning what has been taught and develop critical thinking
   abilities. The combination of AR and building information modeling (BIM)
   in architectural and civil practice, which has immense application
   potential, has become an emerging research trend. Collaboration between
   academics and practice should be enhanced with roles and knowledge of

   Haptic Interaction}},

Abstract = {{Haptic feedback is crucial to immersive experience in virtual and
   augmented reality applications. The existing promising maglev haptic
   devices have advantages of no mechanical friction and low inertia.
   However, their performance is limited by the navigation approach, which
   mainly results from the challenge that it is difficult to obtain high
   precision, high frequency, and good stability with lightweight design at
   the same time. In this study, we reformulate visual-inertial navigation
   as a regression problem, and adopt deep learning to perform fusion
   navigation for maglev haptic interaction. A cascade-LSTM-based
   theta-increment learning method is first proposed to progressively learn
   the increments of target variables. Two cascade LSTM networks are then
   constructed to estimate the increments of position and orientation,
   which are pipelined to accomplish visual-inertial fusion navigation.
   Additionally, we set up a maglev haptic platform as the system testbed.
   Experimental results show that our cascade-LSTM-based visual-inertial
   fusion navigation approach can reach 200 Hz while maintaining
   high-precision navigation (the mean absolute error of the position and
   orientation is less than 1 mm and 0.02 degrees, respectively) for a
   maglev haptic interactive deformation application.}},

Abstract = {{Parents play an important role in students' informal learning with
   technology; however, there is a lack of relevant research, particularly
   regarding parents' opinions on students' learning with emerging
   technology such as augmented reality (AR). This study was therefore
   conducted in an initial attempt to explore parents' user experience (UX)
   of reading an AR book with their children from the perspectives of
   perceptions, expectations, and intention. There were 47 pairs of parents
   and their children invited to participate in a shared AR book reading
   activity in this study. Each parent was interviewed for qualitatively
   understanding their UX of reading the AR book, and their intention to
   use AR books were also quantitatively measured. The results show that
   the parents exhibited several types of perceived UX (i.e., sense of
   reality, novelty, playfulness and entertainment, awareness, memory and
   knowledge, guiding, distracting, and antipathy) and expected UX (i.e.,
   interactivity, portability, sense of touch, vivid animation,
   value-added, and suitability). The findings further addressed the
   relationships between the parents' perceived and expected UX and their
   intention to adopt AR books for their children in the future. Some
   suggestions for the development and popularization of AR book systems
   are also proposed.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{The potential of augmented reality (AR) technology for the study of
   spatial memory and orientation is a new research field. AR defines
   systems that attempt to enhance the user's experience with the physical
   world. In our app, we enhance the sense of sight by adding interactive
   3D elements to the real environment. Our app can be used in any real
   environment so that the experimental conditions during the tasks and the
   way in which an individual navigates are similar to those used in real
   life. With AR, the experimenter has a high level of control of the task
   and can store the participant's responses accurately. The classical
   factors that influence an individual's performance on virtual spatial
   tasks are gender and cognitive factors. The influence of emotional
   factors on spatial performance has been studied more recently. Since AR
   tasks for the study of spatial memory and spatial orientation are new
   developments, little is known about the factors that are related to
   performance on tasks of this type. In our study, we tested 46 young
   adults (26 women) in an AR object-location task that was performed in a
   building. The participants had to memorize the position of eight virtual
   objects while they were walking through the environment. We also
   assessed the participants' performance on an object-recall task, a
   map-pointing task, and a paper-and-pencil spatial orientation task. The
   self-reported importance of different spatial strategies for wayfinding
   and the levels of trait anxiety and wayfinding anxiety were also
   evaluated. Our findings indicate that men performed better on the
   spatial paper-and-pencil test and spent more time completing the
   learning phase of the AR task. The spatial memory for the location of
   the objects in AR and on the map correlated positively. Anxiety was
   related to individual differences in the self-reported use of a spatial
   orientation strategy, but the association among them was weak. Trait
   anxiety was positively related to the time employed by the participants
   during the learning phase of the AR task, whereas wayfinding anxiety
   correlated negatively with the preference for an orientation strategy.
   Our results highlight the importance of anxiety in spatial orientation.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advancements in life-science instrumentation and automation
   enable entirely new modes of human interaction with microbiological
   processes and corresponding applications for science and education
   through biology cloud laboratories. A critical barrier for remote and
   on-site life-science experimentation (for both experts and nonexperts
   alike) is the absence of suitable abstractions and interfaces for
   programming living matter. To this end we conceptualize a programming
   paradigm that provides stimulus and sensor control functions for
   real-time manipulation of physical biological matter. Additionally, a
   simulation mode facilitates higher user throughput, program debugging,
   and biophysical modeling. To evaluate this paradigm, we implemented a
   JavaScript-based web toolkit, ``Bioty,{''} that supports real-time
   interaction with swarms of phototactic Euglena cells hosted on a cloud
   laboratory. Studies with remote and on-site users demonstrate that
   individuals with little to no biology knowledge and intermediate
   programming knowledge were able to successfully create and use
   scientific applications and games. This work informs the design of
   programming environments for controlling living matter in general, for
   living material microfabrication and swarm robotics applications, and
   for lowering the access barriers to the life sciences for professional
   and citizen scientists, learners, and the lay public.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) has becomes more widely used and provides
   the great context of an immersive virtual learning environment. However,
   sometimes the learning effect is influenced by the pleasing value, which
   is always subjective and learning driven. In order to ensure a
   successful launch of the MAR cultural interactive learning tool, it is
   extremely important to predict the pleasing value of design alternatives
   based on the common language understood by students. For learners, in
   the learning process, the value of pleasure comes from the improvement
   of external emotional interest as well as internal cognitive interest
   that learners already have. This research will examine if students have
   problems with operating the MAR, and to understand whether they have
   pleasing value and a learning performance. Thus, this research has
   proposed a difference of visual perception and a construction for the
   evaluation of pleasing value as well as the culture of learning
   performance between media students and students in other majors. The
   research team has chosen different cultural temples in Shi-lin and
   Tam-sui in Taiwan using the MAR systems to evaluate the correctness and
   speed of the reaction in between the two groups represented as: the
   experimental group and the control group. The research objects will be
   the second year/sophomore studentsat Taipei University of Marine
   Technology. There were two classes with different majors and there were
   35 students in each class. This research took one of the classes as the
   experimental group with MAR empirical teaching in cultural and
   environmental learning and other class will be the control group using
   the traditional teaching method. The result from the experiment and the
   ANCOVA analysis indicates: (1) Based on the results of experiments, the
   participants appreciated the MAR approach. The learning performance of
   the students did improve significantly via ACNOVA. (2) The experimental
   group has a more significant effect compared to the control group in the
   aspect from the four learning performance constructions: stylistic,
   cultural value, cultural characterization and innovation services. (3)
   Through the bi-variance statistical analysis (One-Way, ANOVA), there was
   a significant positive correlation between pleasing value and the
   improvement of post-learning interest in the experimental group. This

Abstract = {{The reality is a combination of perception, reconstruction, and
   interaction. Augmented Reality is the advancement that layer over
   consistent everyday existence which includes content based interface,
   voice-based interfaces, voice-based interface and guide based or
   gesture-based interfaces, so designing augmented reality application
   interfaces is a difficult task for the maker. Designing a user interface
   which is not only easy to use and easy to learn but its more interactive
   and self-explanatory which have high perceived affordability, perceived
   usefulness, consistency and high discoverability so that the user could
   easily recognized and understand the design. For this purpose, a lot of
   interface design principles such as learnability, Affordance,
   Simplicity, Memorability, Feedback, Visibility, Flexibly and others are
   introduced but there no such principles which explain the most
   appropriate interface design principles for designing an Augmented
   Reality application interfaces. Therefore, the basic goal of introducing
   design principles for Augmented Reality application interfaces is to
   match the user efforts and the computer display ({''}plot user input
   onto computer output{''}) using an appropriate interface action symbol
   ({''}metaphors{''}) or to make that application easy to use, easy to
   understand and easy to discover. In this study by observing augmented
   reality system and interfaces, few of well-known design principle
   related to GUI ({''}user-centered design{''}) are identified and through
   them, few issues are shown which can be determined through the design
   principles. With the help of multiple studies, our study suggests
   different interface design principles which make designing Augmented
   Reality application interface more easier and more helpful for the maker
   as these principles make the interface more interactive, learnable and
   more usable. To accomplish and test our finding, Pokemon Go, an
   Augmented Reality game, was selected and all the suggested principles
   are implemented and tested on its interface. From the results, our study
   concludes that our identified principles are most important principles
   while developing and testing any Augmented Reality application
   interface.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{With the advancement of technology, the traditional e-learning model may
   expand the realm of knowledge and differentiate learning by means of
   deep learning (DL) and augmented reality (AR) scenarios. These scenarios
   make use of interactive interfaces that incorporate various operating
   methods, angles, perceptions, and experiences, and also draw on
   multimedia content and active interactive models. Modern education
   emphasizes that learning should occur in the process of constructing
   knowledge scenarios and should proceed through learning scenarios and
   activities. Compared to traditional ``spoon-feeding{''} education, the
   model learning scenario is initiated with the learner at the center,
   allowing the person involved in the learning activity to solve problems
   and further develop their individual capabilities through exploring,
   thinking and a series of interactions and feedback. This study examined
   how students in the agriculture technological industry make use of AR
   digital learning to develop their industry-related knowledge and
   techniques to become stronger and more mature so that they unconsciously
   apply these techniques as employees, as well as encouraging innovative
   thought and methods to create new value for the enterprise.}},

Journal = {{ACM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING AND CULTURAL HERITAGE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Digital technologies are being introduced in museums and other informal
   learning environments alongside more traditional interpretive and
   communication media. An increasing number of studies has proved the
   potential of digitally mediated cultural heritage experiences. However,
   there is still a lot of controversy as to the advantages and
   disadvantages of introducing the digital into museum settings, primarily
   related to the risks and investment in terms of time and human and
   financial resources required. This work introduces the MUSETECH model, a
   comprehensive framework for evaluating museum technology before and
   after its introduction into a museum setting. One of the unique features
   of our framework is to consider the evaluation of digital technologies
   from three different perspectives: the cultural heritage professional,
   cultural heritage institution, and museum visitor. The framework
   benefited from an extensive review of the current state of the art and
   from inputs from cultural heritage professionals, designers, and
   engineers. MUSETECH can be used as a tool for reflection before, during,
   and after introducing novel digital media resources. The model covers
   technologies as diverse as mobile museum guides, Augmented and Virtual
   Reality applications, hands-on museum interactives, edutainment
   applications, digitally mediated tangible and embodied experiences, or
   online approaches used for museum education and learning.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of mobile internet services has yielded a variety of
   computation-intensive applications such as virtual/augmented reality.
   Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), which enables mobile terminals to offload
   computation tasks to servers located at the edge of the cellular
   networks, has been considered as an efficient approach to relieve the
   heavy computational burdens and realize an efficient computation
   offloading. Driven by the consequent requirement for proper resource
   allocations for computation offloading via MEC, in this paper, we
   propose a Deep-Q Network (DQN) based task offloading and resource
   allocation algorithm for the MEC. Specifically, we consider a MEC system
   in which every mobile terminal has multiple tasks offloaded to the edge
   server and design a joint task offloading decision and bandwidth
   allocation optimization to minimize the overall offloading cost in terms
   of energy cost, computation cost, and delay cost. Although the proposed
   optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming in nature,
   we exploit an emerging DQN technique to solve it. Extensive numerical
   results show that our proposed DQN-based approach can achieve the
   near-optimal performance.}},

Title = {{A New Software Suite in Orthognathic Surgery : Patient Specific
   Modeling, Simulation and Navigation}},
Journal = {{SURGICAL INNOVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{5-20}},

Abstract = {{Orthognathic surgery belongs to the scope of maxillofacial surgery. It
   treats dentofacial deformities consisting in discrepancy between the
   facial bones (upper and lower jaws). Such impairment affects chewing,
   talking, and breathing and can ultimately result in the loss of teeth.
   Orthognathic surgery restores facial harmony and dental occlusion
   through bone cutting, repositioning, and fixation. However, in routine
   practice, we face the limitations of conventional tools and the lack of
   intraoperative assistance. These limitations occur at every step of the
   surgical workflow: preoperative planning, simulation, and intraoperative
   navigation. The aim of this research was to provide novel tools to
   improve simulation and navigation. We first developed a semiautomated
   segmentation pipeline allowing accurate and time-efficient
   patient-specific 3D modeling from computed tomography scans mandatory to
   achieve surgical planning. This step allowed an improvement of
   processing time by a factor of 6 compared with interactive segmentation,
   with a 1.5-mm distance error. Next, we developed a software to simulate
   the postoperative outcome on facial soft tissues. Volume meshes were
   processed from segmented DICOM images, and the Bullet open source
   mechanical engine was used together with a mass-spring model to reach a
   postoperative simulation accuracy <1 mm. Our toolset was completed by
   the development of a real-time navigation system using minimally
   invasive electromagnetic sensors. This navigation system featured a
   novel user-friendly interface based on augmented virtuality that
   improved surgical accuracy and operative time especially for trainee
   surgeons, therefore demonstrating its educational benefits. The
   resulting software suite could enhance operative accuracy and surgeon
   education for improved patient care.}},

   data back to life in a public exhibition. From the outset this project
   sought to combine the best of both new educational technologies
   (augmented reality) with tactile, physical materials (created using
   laser cutting and 3D printing) that the public could handle and use in a
   way that would break down the barriers between exhibition objects and
   resurrected archival data. The result was an interactive exhibition
   focused upon the emergence of Wellington as a city and the growth of its
   waterfront over the last century and a half. The design research project
   took place between November 2016 and February 2017 and resulted in a
   project exhibition open to the public running from May 2017 to February
   2018. The principle supervisors were Leon Gurevitch and Tim Miller with

   semi-structured focus group interview of both students and teachers was
   conducted. The results showed that learning motivation and system
   acceptance of the experimental group were not significantly better than
   the control group. The theoretical implications of using augmented
   reality for teaching and learning are discussed and practical
   implications are proposed.}},

   benefit from interactive, engaging learning experiences. Experiential
   learning is, therefore, situated in a context relevant to

   schoolchildren and data analysed using thematic analysis. This study
   revealed three new themes specific to schoolchildren's experiential
   learning experiences with AR in museums including: (1) integrating AR
   could further enhance knowledge acquisition, (2) schoolchildren were
   able to identify their preferred learning style, and (3) schoolchildren
   are motivated to continue learning with AR in museums. Theoretical

Abstract = {{Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous
   system which leads to demyelination and neurodegeneration. The T and B
   cells, the body's immune cells, start attacking the brain and spinal
   cord, leading to a variety of symptoms. Alemtuzumab is a recently
   approved disease-modifying therapy that has been shown to have a very
   high impact on MS. However, it has many potentially life-threatening
   side effects which patients are often not aware of. For treatments as
   effective and risky as Alemtuzumab, patients who are considering it must
   be well-informed on the process and the potential side effects. Patient
   education is vital to equip patients with knowledge on their disease and
   treatment, and has shown to be successful in improving the management of
   chronic diseases and increasing medication adherence. Unfortunately, the
   language used is often too complex and at a higher reading level than
   average patients can comprehend, and available resources such as
   pamphlets and websites are often disorganized. This research proposes a
   radically different approach to patient education, using less formal
   channels such as a mobile application to improve health literacy, using
   LEMTRADA (R) (Alemtuzumab) as an example. MS patients were involved in a
   codesign process to produce a series of user-friendly, intuitive and
   interactive graphical interfaces which propose plain language,
   illustrations, animations, audio and Augmented Reality components that
   aim to enhance patients' knowledge retention and recall. Finally, nine
   MS patients along with a senior MS nurse tested the mobile application
   and answered a usability questionnaire that aimed to compare the
   delivery of information with typical websites and pamphlets. Results
   suggested this approach to be highly user--friendly and engaging,
   improving patients' understanding of medical information considerably.
   This research illustrates more engaging channels to communicate with MS
   patients in order to enhance health literacy.}},

Abstract = {{One challenge of using an interesting object such as a scale model as a
   symbol for something else is children's deep interest in the object
   itself. Attending to the model (the symbol) as a toy, children do not
   use information about where in the model a tiny dog is hiding to
   mentally represent where a larger dog is hiding in the full-sized room
   (the referent). Young children use pictures in this way because they are
   relatively uninteresting as objects. Today, interactive images on
   touchscreens function as virtual objects on which to act and which
   respond to the user's actions. In this chapter, we examine how
   interactive symbolic media (e.g., touchscreens, video chat, augmented
   reality) might affect children's symbolic development and the way that
   psychologists think about representational objects. Young children's
   learning about and from interactive media may depend upon adults
   scaffolding children's use of these new cultural tools.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study we present a mixed reality learning environment
   that aims to become a creative, joyful and efficient interdisciplinary
   canvas for learning about history and geography and for concurrently
   fostering computational thinking. The environment makes use of embodied
   affordances and educational robotics and consists of two parts: an
   augmented 3D-tangible model of southern Europe with finger-based
   interaction and a second floor-based augmented robotics track depicting
   European landmarks, where students are asked to perform tasks with
   Mindstorms EV3 robots. The game scenario describes a treasure hunt
   around Europe and students swap between finger-based and robotics-based
   interactive surfaces in two pairs. We evaluated our intervention with
   pre-service teachers in six groups of three or four who played with the
   environment for approximately 45 minutes each. Data collection was
   performed through pre- and post-knowledge test, attitude questionnaire
   and a semi-formal group interview. The answers showed that the mixed
   reality environment improved motivation, engagement and enhanced their
   orientation around Europe's geophysical features. The robotics aspect
   consolidated further their computational thinking skills while being
   highly exciting. The proposed approach was closer to the preservice
   teacher's expectations and interactive experiences, exploited embodied
   learning opportunities and gamified the learning process.}},

Title = {{An interactive and low-cost full body rehabilitation framework based on
   3D immersive serious games}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},

Abstract = {{Strokes, surgeries, or degenerative diseases can impair motor abilities
   and balance. Long-term rehabilitation is often the only way to recover,
   as completely as possible, these lost skills. To be effective, this type
   of rehabilitation should follow three main rules. First, rehabilitation
   exercises should be able to keep patient's motivation high. Second, each
   exercise should be customizable depending on patient's needs. Third,
   patient's performance should be evaluated objectively, i.e., by
   measuring patient's movements with respect to an optimal reference
   model. To meet the just reported requirements, in this paper, an
   interactive and low-cost full body rehabilitation framework for the
   generation of 3D immersive serious games is proposed. The framework
   combines two Natural User Interfaces (NUIs), for hand and body modeling,
   respectively, and a Head Mounted Display (HMD) to provide the patient
   with an interactive and highly defined Virtual Environment (VE) for
   playing with stimulating rehabilitation exercises. The paper presents
   the overall architecture of the framework, including the environment for
   the generation of the pilot serious games and the main features of the
   used hand and body models. The effectiveness of the proposed system is
   shown on a group of ninety-two patients. In a first stage, a pool of
   seven rehabilitation therapists has evaluated the results of the
   patients on the basis of three reference rehabilitation exercises,
   confirming a significant gradual recovery of the patients' skills.
   Moreover, the feedbacks received by the therapists and patients, who
   have used the system, have pointed out remarkable results in terms of
   motivation, usability, and customization. In a second stage, by
   comparing the current state-of-the-art in rehabilitation area with the
   proposed system, we have observed that the latter can be considered a
   concrete contribution in terms of versatility, immersivity, and novelty.
   In a final stage, by training a Gated Recurrent Unit Recurrent Neural
   Network (GRU-RNN) with healthy subjects (i.e., baseline), we have also
   provided a reference model to objectively evaluate the degree of the
   patients' performance. To estimate the effectiveness of this last aspect
   of the proposed approach, we have used the NTU RGB D Action Recognition
   dataset obtaining comparable results with the current literature in
   action recognition.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the influence of digital content on mobile
   devices including flash animations, app books, and augmented reality
   (AR) books on children's reading interest and reading concentration for
   books. The factors responsible for the aforementioned influence were
   also investigated. The results from this research show that flash
   animation can significantly increase the interest in reading and
   concentration. AR books and app books led children to become more
   interested in storybooks but significantly decreased their reading
   concentration. Following a comparison of the digital content, it was
   concluded that all the tested prototypes could positively increase the
   reading interest of children in the same-storyline books. However,
   prototypes with a high level of interactivity could have a negative
   influence on children's reading concentration. The research findings are
   important in determining how to design digital content for children.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented reality (AR) technology has recently been applied to outdoor
   learning in an attempt to overcome the drawbacks associated with
   traditional teaching environments. This study conducted an experiment
   designed to examine how augmented reality (AR) technology in mobile
   devices can be used to generate virtual objects to create a
   context-aware, AR-enabled guided tour application for outdoor learning.
   The participants were 70 elementary school students (average age: 11
   years), who were randomly divided into control and experiment groups.
   The results showed the proposed system provided learners with a
   friendly, interactive interface and rich, engaging media to improve
   learning performance and stimulate the students' internal motivation to
   learn. The system's quantification of the learning motivations noted in
   Keller's ARCS model and Kolb's learning style theory can be used to
   improve the design of the learning materials. In conclusion: (1) The
   proposed system and activity helps stimulate learning intention via the
   pursuit of outdoor learning objectives, (2) the AR technology provides
   learners with contextual information related to the outdoor learning
   environment, and (3) the benefits of the proposed model do not differ
   for students with different learning styles.}},

Abstract = {{Teachers and learners in all sectors of education continue to have
   access to a growing number of mobile augmented reality (AR) applications
   for the creation and implementation of mobile AR experiences and
   learning objects (LOs). In this study, affordances of mobile AR and LOs
   for higher education are investigated through the mobile AR platform HP
   Reveal. Digital trace data from publicly shared and published AR users'
   LOs were examined to investigate affordances of AR technology in
   educational organisations and institutions and their potential
   implications in areas of higher education. For this purpose, a
   quantitative comparative analysis of system data and content from 632 AR
   LOs was conducted at two instances over a 2-year interval period. Each
   LO was thematically coded to determine multimodal functionalities and
   characteristics. Further thematic coding and categorisation revealed
   four emergent categories for affordances in higher education: learner
   interaction, collaboration, cultural exploration and digital
   storytelling. Results also revealed increases over time in the use of
   recorded and online video content and the use of three-dimensional (3D)
   characters for educational purposes. An examination of the affordances
   offered by the AR platform revealed opportunities for educators to
   explore further interactive and collaborative uses of AR with their

Title = {{USE OF AUGMENTED REALITY TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE COMPREHENSION OF
   CONSTRUCTION ASSEMBLIES}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{58-79}},
Abstract = {{The construction industry faces the incessant challenge of adjusting to
   a continuous fluctuation of employees. Consequently, the industry is
   faced with a loss of expertise and practical knowledge required to
   successfully deliver construction projects, especially with older and
   more experienced employees retiring at a rate faster than the incoming
   workforce can replace them. The future of the industry is dependent on
   the competence of this next generation of employees joining the
   construction workforce. Therefore, it is highly desired that new
   employees be equipped with the necessary skills and abilities required
   to manage the complexities inherent in construction processes
   successfully. The lack of practical exposure to on-site construction
   situations during a new employee's college education results in a
   limited spatial and temporal understanding of complex construction
   processes, which adversely influences these new employees' abilities to
   solve problems, therefore limiting their initial productivity.
   This study simulates the environmental context and spatio-temporal
   constraints of several construction assemblies by using Augmented
   Reality (AR) technology combined with a layer of simulated
   visualizations. The superimposition of BIM-based model elements and
   images on real-time site videos functions as a novel pedagogical
   technique which virtually incorporates jobsite experiences into the
   classroom. The jobsite becomes an interactive experience subjected to
   digital manipulation which reinforces and highlights key technique and
   constructability based concepts. Testing revealed that construction
   management students exposed to AR-enabled content were better able to
   identify the elements and tasks related to masonry, roof, and steel
   construction when compared to those students who received typical
   in-class instruction. The results further indicate that ART combined
   with typical classroom instruction provides educators with an advantage
   as they strive to prepare their students for successful careers in
   construction.}},

Abstract = {{Human-computer interaction (HCI) has developed rapidly in recent years,
   and more and more researchers are interested in applying HCI techniques

   This paper implemented a prototype, not only based on augmented reality
   system, but also especially we think about the interactive design.
   Accessibility is achieved by mobile devices and the dynamic switch of
   gesture recognition. By this interactive method, children are able to
   interact with the virtual objects easily and naturally. Consequently,
   children can have a profound and deep understanding of what they learn,

Abstract = {{Immersive virtual reality (iVR) devices are rapidly becoming an
   important part of our lives and forming a new way for people to interact
   with computers and each other. The impact and consequences of this
   innovative technology have not yet been satisfactory explored. This
   empirical study investigated the cognitive and social aspects of
   collaboration in a shared, immersive virtual reality. A unique
   application for implementing a collaborative immersive virtual
   environment (LIVE) was developed by our interdisciplinary team as a
   software solution for educational purposes, with two scenarios for
   learning about hypsography, i.e., explanations of contour line
   principles. Both scenarios allow switching between a usual 2D contour
   map and a 3D model of the corresponding terrain to increase the
   intelligibility and clarity of the educational content. Gamification
   principles were also applied to both scenarios to augment user
   engagement during the completion of tasks. A qualitative research
   approach was adopted to obtain a deep insight into the lived experience
   of users in a LIVE. It was thus possible to form a deep understanding of
   very new subject matter. Twelve pairs of participants were observed
   during their LIVE experience and then interviewed either in a
   semistructured interview or a focus group. Data from these three
   research techniques were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological
   analysis, which is research method for studying individual experience.
   Four superordinate themes-with detailed descriptions of experiences
   shared by numerous participants-emerged as results from the analysis; we
   called these (1) Appreciation for having a collaborator, (2) The
   Surprising ``Fun with Maps{''}, (3) Communication as a challenge, and
   (4) Cognition in two realities. The findings of the study indicate the
   importance of the social dimension during education in a virtual
   environment and the effectiveness of dynamic and interactive 3D
   visualization.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The innate detail of the cerebrovasculature is a
   demonstration of the structural complexity exhibited within the nervous
   system and highlights the challenges intrinsic to surgically influencing
   this system. Bridging the knowledge gap between the 2-dimentional

   challenge requiring experience. Computer graphic technology provides an
   opportunity for the learner to step into a new era of learning via the
   use of interactive 3D models and virtual reality.
   OBJECTIVE: To create virtually anatomically accurate cerebrovascular
   models with superior detail and visual appeal.
   METHODS: High-resolution angiographic radiological studies were utilized
   to create virtual 3Dmodels which were edited for anatomical accuracy and
   artistry post-processing.
   RESULTS: We have created anatomically realistic and detailed 3D virtual
   models of the cerebrovascular structures including the arterial and
   venous systems. The relevant surgical anatomy of the bony andbrain
   structures was also included. In addition, these models were used to
   illustrate the pathoanatomy of a deep vascular malformation to
   demonstrate the potential of this technology. These models allow user
   interactivity in the 3D environment for improved understanding of
   anatomical relationships.
   CONCLUSION: Advances in computer graphics have invited a new era of
   education and experiential learning. The authors have created an
   immersive virtual 3D model of the cerebrovasculature to augment
   education, research, and clinical applications.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Social Computing
   offer promising opportunities to envision and shape augmented
   experiences in a wide variety of cultural spaces. Such interactive
   technologies act as a hook to attract visitor's attention, but if they
   do not provide opportunities to engage people in a more personal and
   meaningful way, they can be soon discarded. Augmented experiences need
   to be motivating and connect with values and expectations of visitors
   and institutions. In a world that is becoming more and more connected
   and moving towards a participatory culture, the need to participate
   actively to co-produce knowledge and meaning can be exploited as a
   powerful intrinsic motivator. In this article, we describe how the
   Social Display Environment (SDE) promotes participation in cultural
   spaces whilst keeping the physical connection with the exhibition
   objects. The SDE makes use of Augmented Reality (AR) technology to
   augment physical artifacts in an exhibition with overlays of digital
   information that is generated by the end user (e.g., the visitor). The
   prototype was exhibited in a cultural center over a weekend to
   investigate different dynamics in terms of content generation, visitors'
   interactions and perceptions with respect to the interplay of digital
   information and physical artifacts. The prototype was assessed as easy
   to learn and useful and showed potential to promote a number of
   meaningful social interactions around the objects involved in the
   exhibition.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe a case study of an empathic design approach
   for designing a technology-assisted teaching in a special needs school
   setting with involvement of teachers and their students. An advanced
   design platform with a large-scale spatial augmented and mixed reality
   system was installed in the gymnasium of the school to enhance the
   teachers' insights toward a solution. Through careful design
   consultations with the teachers in the platform, we designed a full-body
   interactive learning game for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders
   (ASD), which intends to keep their attention focused on the content
   provided for learning. A total of 5 researchers, 21 teachers, and 64
   students were involved in the study. Three observations, three
   workshops, six meetings, and two feasibility studies were conducted with
   the participants in the case study. The game was evaluated in a
   viability testing in cooperation with 23 children (20 males and 3
   females, mild/moderate ASD, 6-12 years-old). The result verified that
   95.7 \% of the children succeeded in implementing the task provided in
   the game, which indicated that the game has the potential to help them
   focus their attention on learning by introducing an element of fun. The
   case study strengthened the importance of an empathic design approach
   that relocates a design platform from researchers' environment to a
   special needs school setting for designing a technology-assisted
   teaching for children with ASD. The design approach helped the study
   participants learn more about the problems, needs, and strengths of the
   children, and provided an appropriate solution together with technology.}},

Abstract = {{Technological advances have led to the introduction of 3D education
   programs specifically designed for dentistry, leading to the author's
   use of these programs in the education of dental students. Based on this
   usage, this paper proposes there are 4 key factors that can enhance
   student education (spatial ability, interactivity, critical thinking,
   and clinical correlations with integration of multiple dental
   disciplines). These key factors can be incorporated into student
   learning through the use of 3D education programs in class. Lessons
   learned from using these programs include the importance of regular use
   in class as well as testing students both visually and textually on the
   content present in such programs. In this way, students will use the
   program and thereby enhance their 3D visualization skills while learning
   the required didactic information. Simply providing students with access
   to such programs without regular use in class and without testing the
   students on the content leads to these programs' lack of use. As a
   result, the students miss an opportunity to enhance their ability to
   visualize structures three dimensionally and manipulate them in their
   minds, a process known as spatial ability that is linked to success in
   the sciences.}},

Abstract = {{The recent developments in virtual and mixed reality by the video game
   and entertainment industries are responsible for increasing user's
   visual immersion and provide a better user experience in games and other
   interactive simulations. However, the interaction between the user and
   simulated environment still relies on game controllers or other
   unnatural handheld devices. In the mixed reality context, the usage of
   more natural and immersive alternative to the game controllers, such as
   the user's hands, may drastically increase the game interface
   experience, allowing a personalized visual feedback of the user's
   interactions in the real-time simulation. There are basically two
   approaches for including the user's hand: a 3D reconstruction based
   method, typically based on depth cameras, or an image-based approach,
   composing the virtual scene with the real images of the user's hands. In
   the composition of the user's hands and virtual elements, perceptual
   discrepancies in the illumination of objects may occur, generating an
   inconsistency in the illumination of the mixed reality environment. A
   consistent illumination of the environment greatly improves the user's
   immersion in the mixed reality application. One way to ensure consistent
   illumination is by estimating the real-world illumination and use this
   information to adapt the virtual world lighting setting. We present the
   Spherical Harmonics Light Probe Estimator, a deep learning based
   technique that estimates the lighting setting of the real-world
   environment. The method uses a single RGB image and does not requires
   prior knowledge of the scene. The estimator outputs a light probe of the
   real-world lighting, represented by 9 spherical harmonics coefficients.
   The estimated light probe is used to create a composite image containing
   both real and virtual elements in an environment with a consistent
   illumination. We validate the technique through synthetic tests
   achieving an RMS error of 0.0573. We show the usage of the method in an
   augmented virtuality application. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Urogynecologic surgery, transvaginal pelvic floor surgery in
   particular, requires learning by feel and high-volume pattern
   recognition. In the era of limited duty hours and case numbers, we
   sought to develop a curriculum, one that can be self-guided, to help
   trainees develop a spatial understanding of the relationships of pelvic
   floor musculature, ligamentous supports, and surrounding
   neurovasculature outside of the operating room.
   INSTRUMENT: We created and piloted an innovative interactive holographic
   using an augmented reality headset to teach surgical anatomy, procedural
   steps, recognition, and management of the uterosacral ligament
   suspension and sacrospinous ligament fixation, the two most common
   native tissue vaginal prolapse repairs.
   EXPERIENCE: Our curriculum was independently trialed by obstetrics and
   gynecology residents and subspecialty fellows and was widely accepted by
   trainees, postgraduate levels 1-6. As compared with usual self-study,
   88\% ranked the modules as ``much{''} or ``very much better{''} and 81\%
   would be ``likely{''} or ``very likely{''} to use mixed reality
   smartglasses to prepare for surgery.
   CONCLUSION: This interactive holographic curriculum is a novel technique
   to teach complex pelvic floor anatomy, key steps, and management of
   complications of the uterosacral ligament suspension and sacrospinous
   ligament fixation. It is widely accepted by obstetrics and gynecology
   residents and gynecologic subspecialty fellows.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, flipped learning has received increasing emphasis; it
   engages students in deriving basic knowledge through instructional
   videos before the class, and hence more time is available for
   practicing, applying knowledge, or student-teacher interaction in class.
   Many scholars have pointed out that, with such a learning approach,
   teachers can design more effective in-class activities by guiding
   students to have higher order thinking as well as interactions with
   peers and teachers. In the meantime, researchers have also indicated
   that employing proper educational technologies or learning strategies
   could further improve students' performance. Therefore, in this study,
   an Augmented Reality (AR)-based learning guiding mode is proposed for
   developing a flipped learning system. To examine the effectiveness of
   the proposed approach, an experiment was conducted in a natural science
   learning activity of an elementary school using the developed system.
   The participants were four classes of 111 fifth graders. Two classes
   were assigned to the experimental group, while the others were the
   control group. Those learning in the experimental group used the
   AR-based flipped learning mode, while those in the control group learned
   with the conventional flipped learning mode. From the experimental
   results, it was found that the AR based flipped learning guiding
   approach not only benefited the students in terms of promoting their
   project performance, but also improved their learning motivation,
   critical thinking tendency, and group self-efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, augmented reality (AR) is considered a promising
   technology that combines virtual information such as videos, images, and
   three-dimensional objects with a real camera view in mobile platforms.
   Interactive AR further provides human-computer interaction to allow the
   user to interact with virtual objects on the mobile display. In this
   paper, we proposed a cloud-based mobile augmented reality interactive
   system (MARIS), which includes MARIS-I for image target tracking and
   MARIS-H for hand motion tracking. MARIS-I estimates the position of the
   image target by adopting a feature-based mean-shift algorithm, which is
   feasible for real-time applications with its small region feature
   detection. MARIS-H provides two tracking modes for fingertip and hack of
   hand tracking to enhance user experiences (UX) for interaction. Either
   the center position for the back of hand or fingertip is first estimated
   by particle filtering technique, which calculates the weighting of each
   particle according to hand or fingertip model. Afterward, the contour of
   the fingertip is estimated by level-set-based contour evolution in the
   fingertip tracking mode. Furthermore, we implement a device/cloud
   architecture for the proposed MARIS to decrease memory requirement and
   computational complexity on the device side. Experimental results show
   that MARIS including MARIS-I and MARIS-H can outperform other existing
   methods for image and hand motion tracking, respectively. The proposed
   MARIS is demonstrated in a picture book to provide fruitful interactive
   UX for digital learning systems.}},

Abstract = {{According to the most recent data from the federal Chemical Safety and
   Hazard Investigation Board, between 2001 and 2011, more than 120
   university laboratory accidents have caused injuries (including one
   death) and millions of dollars in damages. Laboratory-safety lessons
   normally comprise lecture slides alongside occasional movies and tours
   of laboratory facilities. This approach limits the realism of safety
   instruction within the laboratory. In addition, enthusiasm for
   laboratory-safety lectures is often low for both instructors and
   participants. To address these issues, we have developed an
   augmented-reality (AR) program to increase enthusiasm and enhance the
   learning experience for laboratory safety using Microsoft HoloLens. AR
   is an emerging field that uses computer technologies to generate
   realistic images, sounds, and other sensations that replicate a real
   environment. When compared with static or one-sided laboratory lectures,
   our approach creates an interactive learning environment where students
   must physically move around the laboratory to learn about laboratory
   safety. As each of the images and holograms for this open-source program
   can be placed in any location for any laboratory configuration, our
   program is designed to be used in any laboratory around the globe.}},

Abstract = {{Many virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications in

   approximately 10\% more time in making choice on VR and AR than they did
   on the desktop display. Teachers should be aware of this difference and

Abstract = {{Recently released large-scale neuron morphological data has greatly
   facilitated the research in neuroinformatics. However, the sheer volume
   and complexity of these data pose significant challenges for efficient
   and accurate neuron exploration. In this paper, we propose an effective
   retrieval framework to address these problems, based on frontier
   techniques of deep learning and binary coding. For the first time, we
   develop a deep learning based feature representation method for the
   neuron morphological data, where the 3D neurons are first projected into
   binary images and then learned features using an unsupervised deep
   neural network, i.e., stacked convolutional autoencoders (SCAEs). The
   deep features are subsequently fused with the hand-crafted features for
   more accurate representation. Considering the exhaustive search is
   usually very time-consuming in large-scale databases, we employ a novel
   binary coding method to compress feature vectors into short binary
   codes. Our framework is validated on a public data set including 58,000
   neurons, showing promising retrieval precision and efficiency compared
   with state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we develop a novel neuron
   visualization program based on the techniques of augmented reality (AR),
   which can help users take a deep exploration of neuron morphologies in
   an interactive and immersive manner.}},

Abstract = {{Computer simulation has been used pervasively to help students
   understand deeply and visually the theoretical bases of mechanisms. This
   paper proposes an AR mechanism education system (ARMES) to provide a
   tool that can conduct mechanism simulations with high level of
   interaction, easy modeling, and simulation environment and working on
   real mechanisms. The system consists of theoretical lecture mode and
   practical exercise mode. Theoretical lecture mode adopts the basic
   theories of mechanisms from the book Mechanisms and Machine Theory (MMT)
   and provides an interactive learning style for users via an interactive
   tool. Practical exercise mode allows modeling, simulation, kinematical
   characteristics analysis, dynamic analysis, and synthesis based on the
   interaction with the information that has been rendered on a real
   mechanism via the interaction tool. In addition, the modeling is based
   on markers, making the system easy for novice learners to use. The
   simulation is based on geometrical concepts, making the geometrical
   bases of mechanism theories clear for users to understand. The
   evaluation of the system is conducted with 20 participants and a survey.
   The results reveal that by exploiting the characteristics of AR, the
   system is helpful in improving the interaction, visualization, and
   practicality of the mechanism problems. These features will make the
   system a powerful tool for the teaching of mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Calibration accuracy is one of the most important factors to affect the
   user experience in mixed reality applications. For a typical mixed
   reality system built with the optical see-through head-mounted display,
   a key problem is how to guarantee the accuracy of hand-eye coordination
   by decreasing the instability of the eye and the head-mounted display in
   long-term use. In this paper, we propose a real-time latent active
   correction algorithm to decrease hand-eye calibration errors accumulated
   over time. Experimental results show that we can guarantee an effective
   calibration result and improve the user experience with the proposed
   latent active correction algorithm. Based on the proposed system,
   experiments about virtual buttons are also designed, and the interactive
   performance regarding different scales of virtual buttons is presented.
   Finally, a direct physics-inspired input method is constructed, which
   shares a similar performance with the gesture-based input method but
   provides a lower learning cost due to its naturalness.}},

Abstract = {{The use of technology for educational purposes is a consolidated
   reality, and many new tools are constantly being devised and offered for
   use with both normally developing children and children with special
   needs. Nonetheless, a detailed analysis of the processes being
   stimulated and of the goals being pursued is often lacking or absent. In
   this work we describe the design, development and preliminary testing of
   an integrated system which combines the use of smart devices, a physical
   cube, augmented reality (AR) technology, a smart TV, and a software
   application especially designed to stimulate cognitive and social
   functions in pre-school children. The system was tested with three
   groups of children (25 children in total) during kindergarten
   activities. The results show that the system is easy to understand,
   elicits high levels of participation and social interaction, favors
   strategic behaviors, and can be used by the children with limited need
   of instruction and support by the adult. The implications for
   empowerment in typically developing children and the possibilities for
   use with children who have specific impairments in social communication
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by a reduced ability
   to appropriately express social greetings. Studies have indicated that
   individuals with ASD might not recognize the crucial nonverbal cues that
   usually aid social interaction. Social reciprocity depends on the
   ability to empathize with others, to be aware of emotional and
   interpersonal cues, and to respond appropriately; it requires joint
   attention and nonverbal social skills. Fortunately, there is
   evidence-based research which shows that augmented reality (AR) attracts
   the attention of children with ASD and allows them to focus on social
   cues. AR has also been proved effective for teaching social skills.
   However, there is a lack of appropriate instructional scaffolds in AR
   applications to help students organize learning materials. Therefore, in
   this study, we use AR combined with concept map (CM) strategy as a
   training tool to focus on the standard nonverbal social cues to teach
   children with ASD how to appropriately reciprocate when they greet
   others. The learner can integrate the AR with CM strategy to visually
   conceptualize the social scenarios in a tabletop role-play training
   platform. Single-subject research with a multiple-baselines
   across-subject design was used in this study. Our results showed
   substantial increases in the children's target responses during the
   intervention phases compared with the baseline phases. Generalization
   probes were administered during baseline (4-8 sessions for 0.5-1 month),
   intervention (10 sessions for 1.2 months), and maintenance phases (4-8
   sessions for 0.5-1 month) to assess the generalization and maintenance
   of learned skills. The three-phase test data suggest that the AR with CM
   intervention was moderately effective in teaching the target greeting
   responses to children with ASD. The practical and developmental
   implications of the findings are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of an Augmented Reality mobile
   application which aims at sensibilizing young children to abstract
   concepts of music. Such concepts are, for instance, the musical notation
   or the idea of rhythm. Recent studies in Augmented Reality for education
   suggest that such technologies have multiple benefits for students,
   including younger ones. As mobile document image acquisition and
   processing gains maturity on mobile platforms, we explore how it is
   possible to build a markerless and real-time application to augment the
   physical documents with didactic animations and interactive virtual
   content. Given a standard image processing pipeline, we compare the
   performance of different local descriptors at two key stages of the
   process. Results suggest alternatives to the SIFT local descriptors,
   regarding result quality and computational efficiency, both for document
   model identification and perspective transform estimation. All
   experiments are performed on an original and public dataset we introduce
   here.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) is gaining a strong momentum to become a
   major interactive technology that can be applied across domains and
   purposes. The rapid proliferation of MAR applications in global mobile
   application markets has been fueled by a range of freely-available MAR
   software development kits and content development tools, some of which
   enable the creation of MAR applications even without programming skills.
   Despite the recent advances of MAR technology and tools, there are still
   many challenges associated with MAR from the User Experience (UX) design
   perspective. In this study, we first define UX as the emotions that the
   user encounters while using a service, a product or an application and
   then explore the recent research on the topic. We present two case
   studies, a commercial MAR experience and our own Virtual Campus Tour MAR
   application, and evaluate them from the UX perspective, with a focus on
   emotions. Next, we synthesize the findings from previous research and
   the results of the case study evaluations to form sets of challenges,
   opportunities and best practices related to UX design of MAR
   applications. Based on the identified best practices, we finally present
   an updated version of the Virtual Campus Tour. The results can be used
   for improving UX design of future MAR applications, thus making them
   emotionally engaging.}},

Abstract = {{Improving traffic safety is one of the important goals of Intelligent
   Transportation Systems (ITS). In vehicle-based safety systems, it is
   more desirable to prevent an accident than to reduce severity of
   injuries. Critical traffic problems such as accidents and traffic
   congestion require the development of new transportation systems.
   Research in perceptual and human factors assessment is needed for
   relevant and correct display of this information for maximal road
   traffic safety as well as optimal driver comfort. One of the solutions
   to prevent accidents is to provide information on the surrounding
   environment of the driver. Augmented Reality Head-Up Display (AR-HUD)
   can facilitate a new form of dialogue between the vehicle and the
   driver; and enhance ITS by superimposing surrounding traffic information
   on the users view and keep drivers view on roads. In this paper, we
   propose a fast deep-learning-based object detection approaches for
   identifying and recognizing road obstacles types, as well as
   interpreting and predicting complex traffic situations. A single
   convolutional neural network predicts region of interest and class
   probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. We also
   investigated potential costs and benefits of using dynamic conformal AR
   cues in improving driving safety. A new AR-HUD approach to create
   real-time interactive traffic animations was introduced in terms of
   types of obstacle, rules for placement and visibility, and projection of
   these on an in-vehicle display. The novelty of our approach is that both
   global and local context information are integrated into a unified
   framework to distinguish the ambiguous detection outcomes, enhance ITS
   by superimposing surrounding traffic information on the users view and
   keep drivers view on roads.}},

Abstract = {{The design of interactive experiences for archaeological sites entails
   the consideration of the particular characteristics and constraints of
   the exhibition space. Our aim is to address these challenges by
   exploring the potential of a recently emerging interaction paradigm
   called World-as-Support, which is based on projective Augmented Reality
   (AR). In this study, we present the design process of a virtual heritage
   experience for a bomb shelter built during the Spanish Civil War that
   currently belongs to the Barcelona History Museum. The goal of this
   study was twofold. First, we aimed to define the requirements for the
   design of a first prototype based on the World-as Support interaction
   paradigm. Second, we carried out a study with a local school to evaluate
   the benefits of an educational experience based on this paradigm. Our
   results indicate benefits to complement the guided visit: (1) by using
   projective AR to explore different layers of the learning experience;
   and (2) by including collaborative activities based on embodied
   enactments to foster the understanding of historical contents that
   require emotional engagement and critical thinking. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is an essential soft skill that
   should be fostered from a young age. Research shows that a good way of
   teaching such skills is through video games; however, the success and
   viability of this method may be affected by the technological platform
   used. In this work we propose a gameful approach to train CPS skills in
   the form of the CPSbot framework and describe a study involving 80
   primary school children on user experience and acceptance of a game,
   Quizbot, using three different technological platforms: two purely
   digital (tabletop and handheld tablets) and another based on tangible
   interfaces and physical spaces. The results show that physical spaces
   proved to be more effective than the screen-based platforms in several
   ways, as well as being considered more fun and easier to use by the
   children. Finally, we propose a set of design considerations for future

Abstract = {{Affordable 3D cameras, mixed reality headsets, and 3D displays have
   recently pushed the Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)
   technologies into the consumer market. While these technologies have
   been adopted in video-game and entertainment industry, the adoption for
   professional use, such as in industrial and business environment,
   health-care, and education is still lagging behind. In light of recent
   advances in mobile communications, ARIVR could pave the way for novel
   interaction and collaboration of geographically distributed users.
   Despite the technology being available, majority of communication is
   still accomplished using traditional video conferencing technology which
   lacks interactivity, depth perception, and ability to convey non-verbal
   cues in communication. 3D systems for communication have been proposed
   to overcome these limitations; however, very few studies looked into the
   performance and interaction with such technologies. In this paper, we
   report on a study that examined telecollaboration scenario with three
   different Modalities: 2D video-conferencing, 3D stereoscopic interface,
   and 3D stereoscopic interface with augmented visual feedback. Twenty
   participants worked in pairs,assuming the roles of instructor and
   worker, to remotely interact and perform a set of assembly tasks. (C)

Abstract = {{Neuroanatomy can be challenging to both teach and learn within the
   undergraduate veterinary medicine and surgery curriculum. Traditional
   techniques have been used for many years, but there has now been a
   progression to move towards alternative digital models and interactive
   3D models to engage the learner. However, digital innovations in the
   curriculum have typically involved the medical curriculum rather than
   the veterinary curriculum. Therefore, we aimed to create a simple
   workflow methodology to highlight the simplicity there is in creating a
   mobile augmented reality application of basic canine head anatomy. Using
   canine CT and MRI scans and widely available software programs, we
   demonstrate how to create an interactive model of head anatomy. This was
   applied to augmented reality for a popular Android mobile device to
   demonstrate the user-friendly interface. Here we present the processes,
   challenges and resolutions for the creation of a highly accurate, data
   based anatomical model that could potentially be used in the veterinary
   curriculum. This proof of concept study provides an excellent framework
   for the creation of augmented reality training products for veterinary
   education. The lack of similar resources within this field provides the
   ideal platform to extend this into other areas of veterinary education
   and beyond.}},

   Spatial Ability}},

Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Virtual Reality is an incipient technology that is proving very useful
   for training different skills. Our hypothesis is that it is possible to
   design virtual reality learning activities that can help students to
   develop their spatial ability. To prove the hypothesis, we have
   conducted an experiment consisting of training the students using an
   on-purpose learning activity based on a virtual reality application and
   assessing the possible improvement of the students' spatial ability
   through a widely accepted spatial visualization test. The learning
   activity consists of a virtual environment where some simple polyhedral
   shapes are shown and manipulated by moving, rotating and scaling them.
   The students participating in the experiment are divided into a control
   and an experimental group, carrying out the same learning activity with
   the only difference of the device used for the interaction: a
   traditional computer with screen, keyboard and mouse for the control
   group, and virtual reality goggles with a smartphone for the
   experimental group. To assess the experience, all the students have
   completed a spatial visualization test twice: just before performing the
   activities and four weeks later, once all the activities were performed.
   Specifically, we have used the well-known and widely used Purdue Spatial
   Visualization Test-Rotation (PSVT-R), designed to test rotational
   visualization ability. The results of the test show that there is an
   improvement in the test results for both groups, but the improvement is
   significantly higher in the case of the experimental group. The
   conclusion is that the virtual reality learning activities have shown to
   improve the spatial ability of the experimental group.}},

Abstract = {{Although the learning of programming language is critical in science and
   technology education, it might be difficult for some students,
   especially novices. One possible reason might be the fact that
   programming language, especially for three-dimensional (3D)
   applications, is too complex and abstract for these students to
   understand. Programming for 3D applications requires understanding the
   spatial relationship of 3D objects and hence needs a visualization
   technique more. In view of this, this article presents an augmented
   reality (AR)-enhanced learning system that offers visual representation
   and interactivity to help students learn programming for 3D
   applications. To examine the influences of such an AR-enhanced system on
   student learning, a within-group experiment with 34 college students was
   conducted. All students used both of an AR-enhanced version and an
   ordinary version. The findings revealed that the AR-enhanced version
   made students have better learning efficiency than the ordinary system.
   In addition, the AR-enhanced system also made students have enhanced
   perceptions in terms of system usability, flow experience, and usage
   perception. Based on the results, further development of AR-enhanced
   learning systems is also suggested and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented Reality (AR) has been used in various contexts in recent years

   Various studies have shown the utility of AR, especially in the field of
   education, where it has been observed that learning results are
   improved. However, such applications require specialized teams of
   software developers to create and maintain them. In an attempt to solve
   this problem and enable educators to easily create AR content for
   existing textbooks, the ARTutor platform was developed. It consists of a
   web-based application that acts as an AR authoring tool, and an
   accompanying mobile application that is used to access and interact with
   the educational AR content. In addition, the ARTutor application allows
   students to ask questions verbally and receive answers based on the
   contents of the book. This means that the system is suitable for
   distance learning and promotes self-study and independent learning.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{New accessible learning methods delivered through mobile mixed reality
   are becoming possible in education, shifting pedagogy from the use of
   two dimensional images and videos to facilitating learning via
   interactive mobile environments. This is especially important in medical
   and health education, where the required knowledge acquisition is
   typically much more experiential, self-directed, and hands-on than in
   many other disciplines. Presented are insights obtained from the
   implementation and testing of two mobile mixed reality interventions
   across two Australian higher education classrooms in medicine and health
   sciences, concentrating on student perceptions of mobile mixed reality
   for learning physiology and anatomy in a face-to-face medical and health
   science classroom and skills acquisition in airways management focusing
   on direct laryngoscopy with foreign body removal in a distance paramedic
   science classroom. This is unique because most studies focus on a single
   discipline, focusing on either skills or the learner experience and a
   single delivery modality rather than linking cross-discipline knowledge
   acquisition and the development of a student's tangible skills across
   multimodal classrooms. Outcomes are presented from post-intervention
   student interviews and discipline academic observation, which highlight
   improvements in learner motivation and skills, but also demonstrated
   pedagogical challenges to overcome with mobile mixed reality learning.}},

Title = {{Interactive Anatomy-Augmented Virtual Simulation Training}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL SIMULATION IN NURSING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{34-41}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Traditionally, clinical psychomotor skills are taught
   through videos and demonstration by faculty, which does not allow for
   the visualization of internal structures and anatomical landmarks that
   would enhance the learner skill performance.
   Method: Sophomore and junior nursing students attending a large
   Midwestern institution (N = 69) participated in this mixed methods
   study. Students demonstrated their ability to place a nasogastric tube
   (NGT) after being randomly assigned to usual training (control group) or
   an iPad anatomy-augmented virtual simulation training module (augmented
   reality {[}AR] group). The ability of the participants to demonstrate
   competence in placing the NGT was assessed using a 17-item competency
   checklist. After the demonstration, students completed a survey to
   elicit information about students' level of training, prior experience
   with NGT placement, satisfaction with the AR technology, and perceptions
   of AR as a potential teaching tool for clinical skills training.
   Results: The ability to correctly place the NGT through all the
   checklist items was statistically significant in the AR group compared
   with the control group (p = .011). Eighty-six percent of participants in
   the AR group rated AR as superior/far superior with other procedural
   training programs to which they had been exposed, whereas, only 5.9\% of
   participants in the control group rated the control program as
   superior/far superior (p < .001).
   Conclusions: Overall, the AR module was better received compared with
   the control group with regard to realism, identifying landmarks,
   visualization of internal organs, ease of use, usefulness, and promoting
   learning and understanding. (C) 2017 International Nursing Association

Abstract = {{This paper presents research focused on the application of NFC (eng.
   Near Field Communication) technology as well as the use of AR (eng.
   Augmented Reality) in smart packaging. Packaging is smart when it
   employs an interactive element so consumers can learn more about the
   product (price, freshness, transport, storage, etc.), engage with a
   brand (find a brand on social media, web, etc.) and more. The
   interactivity can come from NFC, AR or with traditional technologies
   like a barcode, QR code, etc. NFC is a short-range wireless
   communication technology which transfers data between devices wirelessly
   without the need for an Internet connection. AR is an image recognition
   technology which enables adding digital content and interactive
   experience over a physical touch point of packaging. Connecting more
   modern technologies gives an opportunity to have information about the
   product, its quality, characteristics and information about transport
   and storage at any time. There are various technologies on the market
   that enable packaging to implement these modern requirements. Putting
   together NFC technology and smart packaging creates a quick and
   efficient way to obtain all necessary information about the products
   contained in the database. The AR in recent years tends to take over the
   field of application of NEC technology in packaging. In addition to
   storing information, it also can visualize them in real time and space
   through smart mobile devices cameras. The goal of the paper is to
   compare the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies, the way
   they are implemented in smart packaging technology and the expectations
   for further development. A comparative overview of the main features of
   these technologies that are associated with their use in smart
   packaging. The way these technologies are implemented is shown through a
   variety of commercial examples. The paper introduces two concepts of
   application of one and the other technology through which all
   expectations for further development are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Many ubiquitous technologies, such as augmented and virtual reality,
   virtual field trips, tangible environments and interactive installations
   are continuously being examined for learning about history. All these
   approaches strive to offer an interactive, explorative, authentic, and
   exact regeneration of the past and, they are demanding both in regards
   to their cost and to their development requirements; hence, they are far
   from accessible in school contexts. In this study, we will examine,
   whether interactive low-fidelity low-cost approximations of the real
   objects, and conditions of the past, together with whole-body
   interactions may enable historical understanding in a playful manner. To
   evaluate this claim, sixty-six (66) students of 6th grade played with an
   interactive environment with the characteristics mentioned, in twenty
   (20) groups. Afterwards, students were asked to complete a questionnaire
   assessing their historical understanding and their experience.
   Additionally, all groups participated in brief group interviews.
   Students were very positive towards the environment and considered it as
   enjoyable, intriguing and effective. They claimed that it is preferable
   to both traditional ways of classroom learning and learning devices like
   tablets and mobiles. According to our results, the requirements for
   seamless authenticity may not apply for primary school students and this
   conclusion opens up a lot of opportunities for moving away from
   traditional means of learning about history.}},

Abstract = {{The advancement of Augmented Reality technology is having a great
   influence on the design of learning activities in schools. In this
   chapter, a serial of simulation cases based on 3D Augmented Reality (AR)
   environments are presented, including probability learning in
   mathematics, convex imaging and magnetic field learning in physics,
   inquiry-based microparticles interactive presentation in chemistry and
   EFL children's vocabulary studying in language learning, etc. By AR
   technology, the camera detects the presetting markers which will later
   generate 3D virtual objects, interposing the virtual objects on the real
   scene to produce a blended environment. Experimental results show that
   in an AR-based authentic learning environment, students adopt a natural
   interactive method and enjoy the same experience as in real environments
   due to the abandonment of mouse and keyboard devices. It facilitates an
   innovative and fascinating learning mode which eliminates isolated
   feelings in learning. Furthermore, the AR-based learning environment is
   able to interpose objects which are inaccessible in real life due to
   high expenses, safety consideration or other factors in real-world

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{The it relates to healthcare delivery to remote and under-served areas.
   This is evident in the emergence of many Bluetooth or Wi-Fi-enabled
   medical devices, such as infusion pumps, smart beds, magnetic resonance
   imaging scanners, and HoloLens devices, inter alia, currently in use in
   various hospitals and health facilities. However, the shortage of
   competent operators and lack of specialized physicians and other health
   workers, especially in rural and remote areas that lack specialist
   medical services and major hospitals, still poses a great challenge to
   high-quality health delivery. This research project was to develop a
   proof-of-concept system by implementing an E-consultation system
   leveraged on holographic and augmented reality systems, in a typical
   intensive care unit (ICU) environment, for the prompt and safe delivery
   of remote consultancy services. The overall system was implemented as a
   data center controlling a network of devices and a HoloLens consulting
   system. This E-Consultation approach created an interactive platform
   between a patient and a doctor and was tested at the surgical ICUs of
   Buddhachinaraj Hospital, Phitsanulok, Thailand, with six cardiothoracic
   patients and 14 other accident patients, participating in the study. The
   adaptability of the system was tested developmentally over a period of
   one month. Analysis of the results of a satisfaction survey of the
   collaboration amongst the medical practitioners (doctors and nurses) and
   the development team showed that the average satisfaction was 4.37 for
   system usability and 4.5 for the benefits identified and average
   satisfaction with the development team was 3.87, both out of a maximum
   score of 5 points. The findings from this research demonstrate the
   reliability and efficiency of deploying HoloLens and Hologram devices
   and justify their use in E-Consulting systems in ICU centers.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this research is to articulate and test a new hybrid
   Augmented Reality (AR) environment for conceptual understanding. From
   the theoretical lens of embodied interaction, we have designed a
   multi-user participatory simulation called ARfract where visitors in a
   science museum can learn about complex scientific concepts on the
   refraction of light through full-body immersion using optical
   see-through AR glasses, projection-based AR, and gesture technology. In
   particular, we developed two different types of simulations for ARfract,
   namely a game-based simulation and a non-game simulation to explore how
   the order of different AR simulations influences the perceived
   usability, user behaviors, learning experiences, and learning outcomes.
   For the experiment, 10 dyads were randomly assigned to one of the two
   experimental conditions: 1) the game-to-non-game condition and 2) the
   non-game-to-game condition. The results indicate that the learners who
   experienced the game-based simulation before the non-game simulation
   performed better than did the other group with the reversed experience
   order. This paper also reports the usability, user behaviors, and
   learning experience issues regarding the affordances of hybrid AR
   technologies. The major contribution of this proof-of-concept research
   is that it articulates our understanding of how particular
   configurations (i.e., order) of the emerging technologies (i.e., hybrid
   Augmented Reality systems) and its use can lead to different learning
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Digital humanities are unfamiliar words in Taiwan. With the popularity
   of digital technology and mobile computing, Digital Human Geography in
   both theory and practice have emerged many new potentials and
   development opportunities. However, the research field regarding digital
   human geography can cover many areas, such as: mobile augmented reality,
   local media and service design, urban space interaction, virtual mixed
   space, space humanistic experience, historical materials reproduction,
   creativity of digital local sense, cultural narrative and art
   experience, local action games, mobile learning, and location-related
   business applications etc. This study aims to transfer information to
   specific groups through a simple and straightforward manner. With
   digital technology in combination with humane digital contents, people
   under the scenario of interactive interface are allowed to apply
   geographic information system (GIS) and geo-fencing program to convert
   data into visual images and through today's Infographics to clearly use
   visual design characteristics in content presentation. Therefore, our
   study was to develop a new App, called ``Ai Guang Zhan{''}. People can
   use ``Ai Guang Zhan{''} App to integrate all exhibition related
   services. The App can be downloaded from smartphone or tablet PC for
   users to search in any time the arts and cultural activities and public
   facilities in the nearest place and receive instant mobile navigation
   services among various cultural and creative parks. To understand the
   preference and satisfaction by the people who use the UI interface for
   the APP designed from the study, a random questionnaire survey will be
   conducted in Huashan Cultural and Creative Industry Park and Songshan
   Cultural and Creative Park. The survey results will be used as reference
   for function improvement of next APP version. The primary purpose of
   this research is to propose a model for the development of applications,
   as well as methods for a clearer and easier visual presentation of
   information to be used as a reference for practitioners or application
   designers. The application, developed by the study through the proposed
   processes, was found to be effective; the developed application could be
   utilized as a new and useful tool to facilitate the utilization of
   academic and cultural resources. Additionally, users' specific comments
   and suggestions collected by the study could be adopted as a reference
   for future application development. The application developed by this
   study was found to serve effectively as a method to promote the
   development of art and cultural activities of all sizes in various
   regions, and stimulate the exchange of arts and humanities between urban
   and rural areas. Furthermore, the application has the ability to attract
   younger people to participate in art and cultural activities, find their
   own interests, and explore more corresponding activities with its
   assistance. Future applications associated to art and cultural
   activities are suggested to effectively integrate AR, GIS, and visual
   design (such as Infographics) technologies, and thereby offer users more
   diversified, convenient, and useful functions. Restricted by the
   resources of labor and limited time, the functional design and
   development of the application still requires improvement. Specifically,
   the combination of AR technology and information presentation of art and
   cultural activities, as well as the calculation of relative distance and
   travel time were not presented effectively.
   The next step of the project would involve revising the content and
   functionalities of the application based on users' feedback collected by
   this study, reviewing the acceptance of market responses of the
   application, and seeking a development company or foundation for
   technology transfer. Moreover, we intend to combine more technologies
   such as diversified cross-platform functions, visualized design of
   information, and interactive devices to further improve the application,
   and thereby stimulate social, human, and geographical interactions.}},

Title = {{Layered Software Architecture for the Development of Mobile Learning
   Objects With Augmented Reality}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{57897-57909}},
Abstract = {{According to the m-learning paradigm, mobile learning objects (MLOs) are
   fundamental elements within the teaching-learning process. In this
   context, the integration of technology such as augmented reality (AR),
   incorporates an additional value to an MLO, generating by this, more
   interactive and attractive learning environments, which promotes higher
   involvement and engagement by being immersed in a virtually enhanced
   world. Our research postulates that the development of such MLOs must be
   based on standards, methodologies, and/or a layered software
   architecture which provide the adequate mechanisms to achieve the
   structure and quality attributes needed. Specifically, this paper
   presents the design and development of such architecture which allows
   obtaining MLO complying with the requirements and quality attributes. To
   achieve that, the architecture is composed of five layers: data
   persistence, learning personalization, interactivity, general structure,
   and standards. The layers are independent among them and the lower
   layers provide services to upper layers. In order to probe the benefits
   of the architecture, two prototypes of MLOs with AR were implemented and
   evaluated by a 20 master's degree students focusing on of pedagogical,
   technological, and usability aspects. The results show that the
   architecture contributes no only to integrate AR in MLOs but more
   importantly to obtain MLOs with the quality attributes required as a
   digital educational resource.}},

Abstract = {{The 3D pen is a tool that can output a melted resin from a pen tip to
   form a 3D object. In order to shape an object using a 3D pen, it is
   necessary to practice it and understand how to use it, and many
   beginners find it difficult to handle. Most of the difficulty is caused
   by users not understanding the appropriate moving speed. On the other
   hand, it is necessary to have interactivity in the learning system. In
   3D object drawing learning, a learning system using VR/AR capable of
   displaying three dimensions is desired. In this research, we aim to
   support learning in 3D object drawing, and proposed and developed a 3D
   object drawing learning support system with interactivity. Furthermore,
   the influence of the proposed system and a video learning system on 3D
   object drawing skill by 3D pen is examined. As the results of the
   experiments, it was necessary to practice 3D drawing with 3D pen, and it
   was deduced that interactive learning may be more effective than
   non-interactive learning after practicing 3D pen. In addition, it was
   suggested that interactive learning is more likely to make feel that
   learners improved with respect to speed and drawing related to pen. In
   3D pen drawing learning, it was suggested that those who are not good at
   3D drawing are more likely to feel that interactive learning has
   improved their drawing techniques.}},

Title = {{Touching and traveling on 3D augmented tangible maps for learning
   geography: The FingerTrips approach}},
Journal = {{INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{279-290}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Tangible physical maps which are enhanced by new digital forms
   of interaction can become an invaluable asset for learning geography in
   an embodied way. The purpose of this work is to evaluate an interactive
   augmented three-dimensional (3D) tangible map on which students interact
   and travel with their fingers.
   Design/methodology/approach - A total of 58 fourth-grade students from
   eight elementary schools participated in the study. The participants
   played with the FingerTrips environment in 24 sessions and in groups of
   two or three. Each session lasted for about 20-25 min. After completing
   the interactive game, the students answered a questionnaire concerning
   their attitudes toward the tangible environment and participated in a
   short interview.
   Findings - Students' responses revealed that FingerTrips managed to
   transform the experience of meeting new places, understanding spatial
   relations and learning geography. Students supported that such an
   approach is closer to their interactive experiences and expectations,
   and exploits embodied learning affordances to achieve enjoyable
   learning. Students identified their finger-based trips as an effective
   and intriguing static haptic guidance that helped them learn more
   effectively.
   Originality/value - The specific approach has two distinctive
   characteristics. First, a new interaction style on the map is suggested,
   the use of trips with fingers. Students have to follow predefined
   engraved paths on the 3D terrain to sense distances and changes in
   altitude and ``touch{''} the topology asked to understand and explore.
   Second, it is examined whether a low fidelity interactive 3D terrain,
   which can be easily reconstructed and reprogrammed by primary school
   students, can become a useful canvas for learning geography.}},

Abstract = {{When the target audience is children, the human-computer interaction
   community has firmly established the benefits of involving children
   throughout the design process. Participatory design methods with
   children have been used successfully for the design of learning. Within
   the context of museums, there have been shown to be benefits in children
   designing interactive experiences for themselves and their peers. We
   therefore conjecture that children can contribute towards the design of
   engaging learning materials for museums. With space being a premium
   within museums, the possibility of using augmented reality (AR) with
   existing exhibits is appealing. With the increased availability of
   off-the-shelf wearable devices, research in the field of wearable
   computing has grown in recent years but only a small portion of this
   research is dedicated to the design of wearable technologies for
   children. This chapter presents a study that uses specially constructed
   storyboards to crowdsource ideas for a VR exhibit within a museum in
   which children were enabled to design low-fidelity interfaces and
   interactions within an AR context. The storyboards that the children
   produced were analysed to determine whether the children understood the
   concept of AR. In addition, the drawings were analysed to establish the
   ideas generated, the feasibility of the implementation of proposed
   technology, the interaction methods and, finally, the educational merit.
   We critically reflect on the ideas proposed by the children and the
   methodology for generating ideas relating to museum experiences.}},

Title = {{CoboChild: a blended mobile game-based learning service for children in
   museum contexts}},
Journal = {{DATA TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{52}},

Pages = {{294-312}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a blended mobile
   game-based learning service called CoboChild Mobile Exploration Service
   (hereinafter CoboChild) to support children's learning in an environment
   blending virtual game worlds and a museum's physical space. The
   contextual model of learning (CML) was applied to consider the related
   influential factors affecting museum learning and to promote children's
   continuous learning and revisit motivations.
   Design/methodology/approach CoboChild provides a thematic game-based
   learning environment to facilitate children's interactions with exhibits
   and other visitors. A practical system has been implemented in the
   National Museum of Natural Science (NMNS), Taiwan. A questionnaire was
   used to examine whether CoboChild can effectively fulfill the CML and to
   evaluate the impacts on museum learning.
   Findings CoboChild effectively fulfilled the CML to facilitate
   children's interactive experiences and re-visit motivations in the
   blended mobile game-based learning environment. Most children described
   the system as providing fruitful playfulness while improving their
   interpretations of exhibitions and learning experiences.
   Practical implications CoboChild considers the related contextual
   influences on the effective support of children's learning in a museum,
   and builds a child-centered museum learning environment with highly
   integrated blended learning resources for children. CoboChild has been
   successfully operating in the NMNS since 2011.
   Originality/value This study developed a blended mobile game-based
   learning service to effectively support children's learning in museum
   contexts. The related issues are shown to improve the design of blended
   museum learning services. This innovative approach can be applied to the
   design of other child-centered services for engaging children's
   interactive experiences in museums.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, mobile technology has been developing rapidly and has
   been widely used. There are many successful cases of mobile technology
   applied greatly in today's teaching and even combined with sensing
   devices to overcome the limitations of traditional learning environment.
   In order to make teaching more diversified, teachers currently treat
   field trips as one of the major ways to aid traditional classroom
   teaching. Based on Keller's ARCS motivation model, this study used the
   natural disaster section in the sixth graders' Natural Science-Taiwan
   subject as an example and application of radio frequency identification
   (RFID) technology in mobile devices to develop a context-aware
   ubiquitous learning system to be applied in the 921 Earthquake Museum of
   Taiwan. With the guide of the system, learners can use mobile carriers
   to receive content information displayed in the Museum for learning.
   This study conducted experiment in the 921 Earthquake Museum of Taiwan
   to explore whether using the system for learning significantly improves
   learning outcomes and motivation in comparison to traditional navigation
   learning. Felder \& Silverman's theory of learning style was
   incorporated to explore whether there exists differences in learning
   performance and outcome among learners with different learning styles so
   design and strategies for future teaching system can be improved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and virtual
   reality devices are enabling technologies that may facilitate effective
   communication in healthcare between those with information and knowledge
   (clinician/specialist; expert; educator) and those seeking understanding
   and insight (patient/family; non-expert; learner). Investigators
   initiated an exploratory program to enable the study of AR/MR use-cases
   in acute care clinical and instructional settings.
   Methods: Academic clinician educators, computer scientists, and
   diagnostic imaging specialists conducted a proof-of-concept project to
   1) implement a core holoimaging pipeline infrastructure and open-access
   repository at the study institution, and 2) use novel AR/MR techniques
   on off-the-shelf devices with holoimages generated by the infrastructure
   to demonstrate their potential role in the instructive communication of
   complex medical information.
   Results: The study team successfully developed a medical holoimaging
   infrastructure methodology to identify, retrieve, and manipulate real
   patients' de-identified computed tomography and magnetic resonance
   imagesets for rendering, packaging, transfer, and display of modular
   holoimages onto AR/MR headset devices and connected displays. Holoimages
   containing key segmentations of cervical and thoracic anatomic
   structures and pathology were overlaid and registered onto physical task
   trainers for simulation-based ``blind insertion{''} invasive procedural
   training. During the session, learners experienced and used
   task-relevant anatomic holoimages for central venous catheter and tube
   thoracostomy insertion training with enhanced visual cues and haptic
   feedback. Direct instructor access into the learner's AR/MR headset view
   of the task trainer was achieved for visual-axis interactive
   instructional guidance.
   Conclusion: Investigators implemented a core holoimaging pipeline
   infrastructure and modular open-access repository to generate and enable
   access to modular holoimages during exploratory pilot stage applications
   for invasive procedure training that featured innovative AR/MR
   techniques on off-the-shelf headset devices.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HISTOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed students' perceptions of a ubiquitous 360 degrees
   learning environment (ULE) in histotechoology comparing ULE perceptions
   to conventional web-based learning environment (WLE). Based on
   pervasive, seamless ubiquitous technologies and computing, ULE combines
   an authentic learning environment, i.e. histotechnology laboratory, with
   digital learning resources, embedded functional objects, mobile devices
   and sensing technologies. A highly usable user interface was created
   using a 360 degrees spherical panorama imaging technique. The ULE was
   developed and conducted by a research group. Students' perceptions on
   360 degrees ULE use were assessed in a quasi-experimental pilot study.
   From a histotechnology course, 57 out of 100 students participated
   voluntarily. The 360 degrees ULE experimental group (n = 29) and WLE
   control group (n = 28) studied for 8 wks in 2014-2105. Assessment
   focused on the main criteria for ULE, i.e. flexibility, personalization,
   context-awareness, interactivity subscales. The WLE control group was
   assessed as more valuable from flexibility, context-awareness, and
   interactivity perspectives. Only the personalization aspect was
   perceived as higher in ULE than WLE. WLE group numerical values were
   systematically higher than the ULE group values, though statistically
   significant differences were revealed between groups. Both ULE and WLE
   environments supported learning. All measured subscales were assessed as
   high. Personalization and context-awareness aspects were evaluated as
   highest in both ULE and WLE groups, while interactivity was perceived as
   lowest. This study has implications for those developing
   technology-enhanced learning environments. Our developed 360 degrees ULE
   could be easily implemented for health, medical, or nursing education as
   either practical training or continuing education.}},

Abstract = {{The teaching aim of mechanical drawing is to cultivate the students'
   graphic interpreting ability, plotting ability, inter-space imagination
   and innovation ability. For engineering students in Chinese
   universities, a mechanical drawing course focused on 3D and 2D
   inter-space transformation is often difficult to master. The ordinary
   dull teaching method is insufficient to stimulate students' spatial
   imagination capability and interest in learning and cannot meet
   teachers' need to explain complicated graphical relationships. In this
   paper, we design an interactive teaching system that uses mobile
   augmented reality to improve the learning efficiency of a mechanical
   drawing course. To check the effect of the proposed system, we carried
   out a case study of two classes in mechanical drawing. The results
   demonstrate that the class for which an interactive teaching system
   based on mobile augmented reality technology was adopted is
   significantly superior to the class for which the ordinary dull teaching
   approach was adopted with regard to the degree of students' proficiency
   in the course's key, difficult content areas, their spatial imagination
   capability, and their interest in learning and study after class.}},

Abstract = {{Lack of programming skills is a barrier to the engagement of teachers in
   the development and customisation of their own applications. Visual
   Environment for Designing Interactive Learning Scenarios (VEDILS), a
   visual tool for designing, customising and deploying learning
   technologies, provides teachers with a development environment with a
   low entry threshold. Current mobile devices are equipped with sensors
   and have sufficient processing power to use augmented reality
   technologies. Despite the heavy use of mobile devices in students'
   lives, the use of augmented reality mobile applications as learning
   tools is not widespread among teachers. The current work presents a
   framework comprising the development tool and a method for designing and
   deploying learning activities. It focuses on the augmented reality
   components of the authoring tools, which allow users to create their own
   mobile augmented reality learning apps. It also present the results of
   the evaluation of the framework with 47 third-level educators, and two
   case studies of classroom implementations of mobile augmented reality
   apps developed by these educators. The results illustrate the
   suitability of the framework and authoring tool for supporting users
   without programming skills in developing their own apps. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{When preparing young medical students for clinical activity, it is
   indispensable to acquaint them with anatomical section images which
   enable them to use the clinical application of imaging methods. A new
   Augmented Reality Magic Mirror (AR MM) system, which provides the
   advantage of a novel, interactive learning tool in addition to a regular
   dissection course, was therefore tested and evaluated by 880 first-year
   medical students as part of the macroscopic anatomy course in 2015/16 at
   Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat (LMU) in Munich. The system consists of
   an RGB-D sensor as a real-time tracking device, which enables the system
   to link a deposited section image to the projection of the user's body,
   as well as a large display mimicking a real-world physical mirror. Using
   gesture input, the users have the ability to interactively explore
   radiological images in different anatomical intersection planes. We
   designed a tutorial during which Students worked with the system in
   groups of about 12 and evaluated the results. Subsequently, each
   participant was asked to assess the system's value by filling out a
   Likert-scale questionnaire. The respondents approved all statements
   which stressed the potential of the system to serve as an additional
   learning resource for anatomical education. In this case, emphasis was
   put on active learning, 3-dimensional understanding, and a better
   comprehension of the course of structures. We are convinced that such an
   AR MM system can be beneficially installed into anatomical education in
   order to prepare medical students more effectively for the clinical
   standards and for more interactive, student-centered learning. (C) 2017

Title = {{Effect of augmented reality game Pokemon GO on cognitive performance and
   emotional intelligence in adolescent young}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{49-63}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The main aim was to analyse the effect of 8 weeks of Pokemon GO on
   cognitive performance (memory, selective attention, concentration,
   mathematical calculation and linguistic reasoning) and emotional
   intelligence (well-being, self-control, emotionality and sociability) in
   Spanish adolescents between 12 and 15 years. A longitudinal design was
   used, with a Control Group (n = 103) that did not use Pokemon GO, and
   Experimental Group (n = 87) that used Pokemon GO during 8 weeks. Age,
   sex, BMI, maternal educational level, number of computers at home and
   moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were used as confounders.
   Results showed that players walked 54 km and spent 40 min/day playing in
   this period. Boys played more, won more points and reached a higher
   level in the game than girls. The players playing Pokemon GO
   significantly increased their selective attention (p = 0.003),
   concentration levels (p < 0.001), and sociability levels (p = 0.003)
   against their peers. It is concluded that Pokemon GO increases, in a
   playful way, the amount of daily exercise in adolescents, could
   positively affect their cognitive performance, and improve the social
   relationships. Further studies are required to perform comparisons
   between single and collaborative play and to identify the pedagogical
   benefits through some subjects such as Physical Education. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Museum researchers have long acknowledged the importance of dialogue in
   informal learning, particularly for open-ended exploratory exhibits.
   Novel interaction techniques like full-body interaction are appealing
   for these exploratory exhibits, but designers have not had a metric for
   determining how their designs are supporting productive learning talk.
   Moreover, with the incorporation of digital technologies into museums,
   researchers and designers now have the opportunity for in situ A/B
   testing of multiple exhibit designs not previously possible with
   traditionally constructed exhibits, which once installed were difficult
   and expensive to iterate. Here we present a method called Scoring
   Qualitative Informal Learning Dialogue (SQuILD) for quantifying
   idiosyncratic social learning talk, in order to conduct in situ testing
   of group learning at interactive exhibits. We demonstrate how the method
   was applied to a 2 x 2 experiment varying the means of control
   (full-body vs. handheld tablet controller) and the distribution of
   control (single-user-input vs. multi-user-input) of an interactive data
   map exhibit. Though pilot testing in the lab predicted that full-body
   and multi-input designs would best support learning talk, analysis of
   dialogue from 119 groups' interactions revealed surprising nuances in
   the affordances of each. Implications for embodied interaction design
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented reality (AR) has received much attention in the cultural
   heritage domain as an interactive medium for requesting and accessing
   information regarding heritage sites. In this study, we developed a
   mobile AR system based on Semantic Web technology to provide contextual
   information about cultural heritage sites. Most location-based AR
   systems are designed to present simple information about a point of
   interest (POI), but the proposed system offers information related to
   various aspects of cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible,
   linked to the POI. This is achieved via an information modeling
   framework where a cultural heritage ontology is used to aggregate
   heterogeneous data and semantically connect them with each other. We
   extracted cultural heritage data from five web databases and modeled
   contextual information for a target heritage site (Injeongjeon Hall and
   its vicinity in Changdeokgung Palace in South Korea) using the selected
   ontology. We then implemented a mobile AR application and conducted a
   user study to assess the learning and engagement impacts of the proposed
   system. We found that the application provides an agreeable user
   experience in terms of its affective, cognitive, and operative features.
   The results of our analysis showed that specific usage patterns were
   significant with regard to learning outcomes. Finally, we explored how
   the study's key findings can provide practical design guidance for
   system designers to enhance mobile AR information systems for heritage
   sites, and to show system designers how to support particular usage
   patterns in order to accommodate specific user experiences better.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial vision is critical to understanding all other knowledge to be
   taught in all technical fields. Students need the ability to determine
   the three-dimensional shape of an object from its two-dimensional
   graphic representation. After using drawings in both two and three
   dimensions on the backboard, an opportunity to use digital media in
   various more interactive ways is proposed to change the ways in which
   the content is presented. Such digital tools include augmented reality,
   PDF3D or 3D visualization software like SketchUp. This article shows how
   3D ICT objects can help communication for the compression of terrains
   represented by contours when they are not completely understood. It also
   discusses how to proceed to obtain them and the advantages and
   disadvantages of the three ways of visualization chosen. Conducting

Abstract = {{With the increasing attention to the role of parents in children's
   learning, what issues parents consider and how they behave when learning
   with their children when confronted with the emerging augmented reality
   (AR) technology may be worth exploring. This study was therefore
   conducted to qualitatively understand parents' conceptions of AR
   learning and approaches to learning by AR with their children. A total
   of 90 pairs of parents and children were invited to participate in an AR
   book reading activity held in 2015; all of the parents were then
   interviewed to acquire the research data. Through the phenomenographic
   method, this study generated several categories of the parents'
   conceptions of and approaches to AR learning. Further analysis
   identified the relationships between parents' conceptions and
   approaches. For example, the parents holding cohesive conceptions (e.g.,
   learning by AR as attaining in-depth understanding) tended to use deep
   approaches (e.g., offering guidance to connect life experiences with the
   book content for thorough reading). Based on the findings, a framework
   of interactive AR book systems for child-parent shared reading is
   proposed. This study was expected to initiate research in the area of
   learning by AR in informal learning environments.}},

   the App, the first thing they have to do is login with matching using
   usernames and passwords. Camera will be automatically activated once the

   patterns by this App; however, if the object is only in a 2D form, the
   pattern will be unidentified. Considering those results, it can be
   concluded that the application is such a user-friendly learning medium

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Structural analysis is an introductory core course that is taught in
   every civil engineering program as well as in most architectural and
   construction engineering programs. Previous research unveils students'
   deficits in understanding the behavior of structural elements in a
   three-dimensional (3D) context due to the shortcomings of traditional
   lecturing approaches, which put too much emphasis on the analysis of
   individual structural members, thereby falling short in providing a
   solid, easy-to-follow, and holistic approach to analyzing complex
   structures with a large number of interconnected elements. In this
   paper, the authors introduce a new pedagogy for teaching structural
   analysis that incorporates mobile augmented reality (AR) and interactive
   3D visualization technology. The goal of this study is to enhance the
   contents used in structural analysis textbooks and on worksheets by
   visualizing discrete structural members employing AR along with
   interactive 3D models in order to illustrate how the structures behave
   under different loading conditions. Students can interactively change
   the load and observe the reaction resulting from this change with the
   instant feedback provided by the AR interface. The feasibility of AR
   concepts and interaction metaphors, as well as the potential of using AR
   for teaching structural analysis are investigated, specifically by
   focusing on challenges regarding content integration and interaction. An
   AR application is designed and developed, and a pilot study is conducted
   in a junior level structural analysis class to assess the pedagogical
   impact and the design concepts employed by the AR tool. Control and test
   groups are deployed, and students' performance is measured using pre-
   and post-tests. The results of the pilot study indicate that the
   utilized AR design concepts have potential to contribute to students'
   learning by providing interactive and 3D visualization features, which
   support constructive engagement and retention of information in
   students.}},

Abstract = {{Young people now must compete in a global, knowledge-based,
   innovation-centered economy; they must acquire not just academic
   knowledge, but also character attributes such as intrinsic motivation,
   persistence, and flexibility. To accomplish these ambitious goals, the
   National Research Council (2012) of the United States recommends the use
   of ``deeper learning{''} classroom strategies. These include case-based
   learning, multiple representations of knowledge, collaborative learning,
   apprenticeships, life-wide learning, learning for transfer,
   interdisciplinary studies, personalized learning, connected learning,
   and diagnostic assessments. Immersive media (virtual reality, multi-user
   virtual environments, mixed and augmented realities) have affordances
   that enhance this type of learning. EcoXPT is an inquiry-based middle
   school curriculum on ecosystem science that invites students into
   immersive experimentation with scaffolding tools that support deeper
   learning. This includes a case-based approach situated in an unfolding
   eutrophication scenario in which students learn new information from
   their observations over space and time, speaking with virtual characters
   in the world, and gathering information in the field guide and other
   sources. Diagnostic assessments of students' progress are based on
   multiple sources, including process data from various types of logfiles.
   Multiple varied forms of representation convey perceptual, graphical,
   and experimental data, enabling students to investigate relationships
   between variables. Students are apprenticed in the ways of knowing of
   ecosystems scientists, which involves interdisciplinary knowledge.
   Students collaborate in teams of two, subdividing the tasks of gathering
   evidence.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, whether using Augment Reality (AR)-based learning
   materials could benefit high school students in the process of Chinese
   writing was explored, along with the pros and cons of using AR for
   acquiring Chinese writing skills. In order to reduce the gap between the
   designers and practitioner teachers, Chinese instructors were invited to
   co-design the AR-based writing materials to achieve the integration of
   learners, teachers and educational system technology developers in a
   collaborative process. The AR-based writing support system was provided
   to a total of 30 twelfth-grade students who participated in the
   experiment. The students in the experimental group participated in the
   writing activity using both AR-based learning material and paper-based
   supports, while the control group worked with only paper-based writing
   support materials. The results revealed that the AR techniques helped
   the intermediate-level students the most in their writing performance of
   content control, article structure and wording. The students, especially
   the low-achievers, reflected that the functions of the AR system
   supported them to start writing the first paragraph more quickly, and
   enriched their ideas. A possible mode for integrating AR techniques in
   writing courses is proposed. This paper could serve as a reference for
   educators and learning technology researchers who wish to design AR

Abstract = {{Augmented Realty (AR) offers a novel method of blending virtual and real
   anatomy for intuitive spatial learning. Our first aim in the study was
   to create a prototype AR tool for mobile devices. Our second aim was to
   complete a technical evaluation of our prototype AR tool focused on
   measuring the system's ability to accurately render digital content in
   the real world. We imported Computed Tomography (CT) data derived
   virtual surface models into a 3D Unity engine environment and
   implemented an AR algorithm to display these on mobile devices. We
   investigated the accuracy of the virtual renderings by comparing a
   physical cube with an identical virtual cube for dimensional accuracy.
   Our comparative study confirms that our AR tool renders 3D virtual
   objects with a high level of accuracy as evidenced by the degree of
   similarity between measurements of the dimensions of a virtual object (a
   cube) and the corresponding physical object. We developed an inexpensive
   and user-friendly prototype AR tool for mobile devices that creates
   highly accurate renderings. This prototype demonstrates an intuitive,
   portable, and integrated interface for spatial interaction with virtual
   anatomical specimens. Integrating this AR tool with a library of CT
   derived surface models provides a platform for spatial learning in the
   anatomy curriculum. The segmentation methodology implemented to optimize
   human CT data for mobile viewing can be extended to include anatomical
   variations and pathologies. The ability of this inexpensive educational
   platform to deliver a library of interactive, 3D models to students
   worldwide demonstrates its utility as a supplemental teaching tool that
   could greatly benefit anatomical instruction. Clin. Anat. 30:736-741,

   background of the mobile application are algorithms performing
   vision-based estimation and wireless control of the test-bed. In this
   way, the sensing, storage, computation, and communication (SSCC)
   capabilities of mobile devices are leveraged to relieve the need for
   laboratory-grade equipment, improving the cost-effectiveness and
   portability of platforms to conduct hands-on laboratories. We
   hypothesize that students using the MRLE platform demonstrate
   improvement in their knowledge of dynamic systems and control concepts
   and have generally favorable experiences using the platform. To validate
   the hypotheses concerning the educational effectiveness and user
   experience of the MRLEs, an evaluation was conducted with two classes of
   undergraduate students using an illustrative platform incorporating a
   tablet computer and motor test-bed to teach concepts of dynamic systems
   and control. Results of the evaluation validate the hypotheses. The
   benefits and drawbacks of the MRLEs observed throughout the study are
   discussed with respect to the traditional hands-on, virtual, and remote
   laboratory formats. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An immersive real-time visualization system of 3-D magnetic field for
   educational purposes is presented. This immersive visualization system
   is based on augmented reality technology. The proposed system provides
   observation of a magnetic field distribution and its stereoscopic vision
   in 3-D space using head mounted display. To improve the visualization
   capabilities, a new real-time method for drawing magnetic flux lines in
   3-D space is developed and presented in this paper. It enables a user to
   easily observe and grasp a magnetic field generated by multiple sources
   (e.g., magnets and/or multiple coils) in an augmented 3-D space.
   Additionally, it permits a user to freely and interactively move the
   magnetic sources within the visualization space and to observe the
   magnetic fields interference in real-time. As a result, one can
   intuitively and easy visualize, observe and grasp the magnetic field
   even in 3-D space.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to examine the effects of augmented reality
   technology on stories in terms of narrative skill, story length and
   creativity and also to examine correlations between these variables.
   Posttest-only design with a nonequivalent group model was used. In this
   study, the sample consisted of 100 fifth-grade elementary students,
   comprising 46 boys and 54 girls. Purposive and convenience sampling
   methods were applied. For purposive sampling, the group's ages,
   education levels, and experiences in storytelling activities were
   gathered, and for convenience sampling, easy access to schools was
   considered. As data collection tools, a suitable narrative scale was
   used which was found in the literature and creative story form was
   developed by the researcher. According to the findings, mean scores for
   all variables for the experimental group were higher than those for the
   control group. Also, a statistically significant mean difference was
   found between the experimental and control groups with regard to
   narrative skill, length of stories, and creativity in stories. In fact,
   a positive correlation was found between all variables. It is important
   to recognize when a technology is found to contribute positively to
   narrative skill and creativity in telling stories, and to ensure this
   technology is used. Determining correlation between these variables may
   provide a contribution to studies about evaluating the effect of the new
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the impact of an augmented reality iPad-based
   mobile game, called The Great STEM Caper, on students' interaction at a
   science center. An open-source, location-based game platform called ARIS
   (i.e. Augmented Reality and Interactive Storytelling) was used to create
   an iPad-based mobile game. The game used QR scan codes and a
   challenge-based game structure to encourage engagement in science.
   Participants wore head-mounted GoPro cameras to record interactions
   within the physical and social environment. The purpose of this research
   was to study the impact of a mobile game on student interactions in a
   science center. Gender differences in gameplay behaviors and perceptions
   were compared. The study included a quasi-experimental design with two
   groups: one group that played the iPad mobile game during their science
   center visit, and one group that explored the science center in a
   traditional free exploration manner. Video data from the GoPro cameras
   provided examination of the different ways students interacted with the
   science center. The female students outperformed the male students on
   every measure of the iPad game achievement. Lazzaro's (2004) four types
   of fun was used to describe the gender differences in game perceptions
   and interactions. Females tended to enjoy hard fun and collaborative
   people fun, while males enjoyed easy fun and competitive people fun. The
   females tended to be more goal-oriented, persistent in the face of
   difficulty, and appreciative of hard fun. The results of this study have
   implications for the design of mobile-based gaming technology to
   encourage interaction in an informal science center setting.}},

Abstract = {{Modularity, modifiability, reusability, and API usability are important
   software qualities that determine the maintainability of software
   architectures. Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR, AR, MR)
   systems, modern computer games, as well as interactive human-robot
   systems often include various dedicated input-, output-, and processing
   subsystems. These subsystems collectively maintain a real-time
   simulation of a coherent application state. The resulting
   interdependencies between individual state representations, mutual state
   access, overall synchronization, and flow of control implies a
   conceptual close coupling whereas software quality asks for a decoupling
   to develop maintainable solutions. This article presents five
   semantics-based software techniques that address this contradiction:
   Semantic grounding, code from semantics, grounded actions, semantic
   queries, and decoupling by semantics. These techniques are applied to
   extend the well-established entity-component-system (ECS) pattern to
   overcome some of this pattern's deficits with respect to the implied
   state access. A walk-through of central implementation aspects of a
   multimodal (speech and gesture) VR-interface is used to highlight the
   techniques' benefits. This use-case is chosen as a prototypical example
   of complex architectures with multiple interacting subsystems found in
   many VR, AR and MR architectures. Finally, implementation hints are
   given, lessons learned regarding maintainability pointed-out, and
   performance implications discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A situated Chinese cultural festival learning system based on motion
   sensing is developed in this study. The primary design principle is to
   create a highly interactive learning environment, allowing learners to
   interact with Kinect through natural gestures in the designed learning

   characteristics: the learning activities and contents are designed
   according to the key elements of situated learning theory; the system
   combines augmented reality with a real environment to provide
   story-based learning situations for learners. The Lantern Festival is
   used as the learning objective of this study, and 74 students from four
   third to fourth-grade level classes at Shanhua Elementary School in
   Tainan City were recruited as the study participants. In the experiment,
   the students were divided into a control group receiving traditional
   teaching and an experimental group that employed the system developed in
   this study. To assess the proposed system, questionnaire analysis and
   learning achievement assessment were conducted. The questionnaire
   includes situated learning, learning materials and operating
   interaction. The learning achievement was assessed by using the t-test
   for pre-test and post-test. The experiment shows that the system can

   load, foreign language learning anxiety, and learning effectiveness of
   the students with different learning styles (i.e., serial or global)
   were assessed. The results showed that the students using the
   self-directed or task-based AR educational game system had similar and
   high learning effectiveness, although those using the self-directed
   system revealed higher flow experience. However, the students with a
   serial learning style had lower mental effort and foreign language
   learning anxiety regardless of using the self-directed or the task-based
   AR educational game system. It was found that the challenge and control
   of the system conformed to the students' proficiency. The learning
   objects (e.g., pen, pencil, book, chair, desk, eraser, ruler, etc.) did
   not have a restrictive learning sequence. Providing free learning steps
   was preferable, and restricting which step to begin with was not
   necessary. This study confirms that the mental efforts of students are
   greater when they experience more learning anxiety at the same time;
   however, it is not the case that lower learning anxiety and mental
   effort is better for learning. On the contrary, a little learning
   anxiety and mental effort, but not too much, is helpful for learning.

Abstract = {{As 21st century skills (e.g., creativity and collaboration) are
   informally developed by tech-savvy learners in the Digital Age,
   technology-based strategies to develop such skills in non-formal and
   formal contexts are necessary to reduce the gap between academic and
   business organizations on the one hand, and the revolutionary wave of
   self-taught networked learners on the other. In light of this, the
   Gradual Immersion Method (GIM) was designed to enhance collaborative
   creativity using interactive devices and augmented reality (AR), to
   support creativity-based learning, such as in the integrated study of
   Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM). The GIM
   consists of three intuitive modules wherein learners collaboratively
   achieve learning object goals through interaction with images and 3D
   models, in a sequential transition from 2D to 3D and then to AR. In this
   paper, the process is illustrated through the deployment of the GIM in
   the study of Surrealist art features, using the Art Movement Learning
   App (AMLA), an area-specific technological solution based on the GIM,
   designed as foundation architecture for the investigation of a wide
   range of topics in an interactive manner.}},

Abstract = {{Object 3D model creation is a difficult task and it typically requires
   professional modeling tools or devices. For nonexpert users who want to
   create simple 3D applications, these approaches are either too expensive
   or require extensive study and learning of the complex modeling tools.
   In this work, we develop a modeling system that allows an amateur to
   interactively create a simple 3D model for his/her applications. The
   system is developed on the basis of augmented reality (AR) technology
   with a tangible user interface. AR allows a user to operate virtual
   models in a real 3D environment; thus, the operation is more natural and
   intuitive than traditional 2D-graphical-interface-based modeling tools.
   A user can easily change his/her viewpoint by rotating an AR marker or
   moving the physical camera. An AR pen is also designed in the system,
   which serves as a tangible device that allows a user to select,
   translate, rotate, and modify the created model. With the AR pen, a user
   can scale the model and combine it with other models to form a large
   model with diverse shapes. In particular, we also include a free-form
   deformation (FFD) tool in the system so that the users can modify the
   shape of a model using the tangible interface and create an imagined
   object. To extend the application range of the proposed system, we port
   the system to mobile devices such as tablets or smartphones so that any
   user with suitable devices can create his/her 3D models using the
   proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{In an educational perspective, unlike other disciplines, hands-on
   practice is difficult to come by in Civil Engineering. By providing a
   student with a realistic 3D simulation, we propose a concept that
   improves the understanding of the individual and eliminate guess-work
   entirely. Our platform that makes education fun and interactive by
   eliminating the constraints of a conventional teaching environment by
   incorporating Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) as a tool.
   AR can help the target audience visualize a model (to scale) in all
   three dimensions in the palm of their hand. This chapter explores the
   use of interactive 3D game environments in design visualization in
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) by adopting various available
   software packages and APIs. VR will allow the prospective customer to
   enter and explore a structure before it is constructed. This can be
   achieved by making use of a powerful game engine, in this case, Unity3D.
   In this chapter, we will describe ways to pivot Unity's functions
   towards the benefit of civil engineering.}},

Title = {{Gesture Interaction for Coronary Heart Diseases Based on Wavelet
   Transform and Semi-Continuous Hidden Markov Model in Augmented Reality}},
Journal = {{RECENT ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL \& ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Background: Most doctors are used to locate the vascular stenosis
   position first then clinically estimate vascular stenosis by the CAG
   images instead of using mouse, keyboard and computer during the
   preoperative diagnosis. Therefore, it is necessary to have an effective,
   intuitive and natural method to replace the existing preoperative
   diagnosis mode for diagnosing the coronary heart disease.
   Methods: This work presents the gesture interactive diagnostic method
   for coronary heart disease based on wavelet transform and
   Semi-continuous Hidden Markov Model in Augmented Reality. Firstly, the
   dynamic gesture trajectory is analyzed by using K-means cluster
   algorithm to determine the gesture trajectory plane. Secondly, the
   integrity of the trajectory is preserved on the sensor plane by
   employing trajectory projection and space rotation transformation.
   Thirdly, the features include the azimuth of gesture trajectory and the
   changes of hand shape are extracted. Meanwhile, the azimuth of gesture
   trajectory is analyzed by utilizing wavelet transform and the
   singularity of the trajectory is detected to compute the state number of
   SCHMM for all the dynamic gestures. The gesture training is completed by
   employing Baum-Welch algorithm with multi-features and multi-observation
   sequences. Ultimately, gesture recognition is realized by using Viterbi
   algorithm based on self-learning mechanism. It is then applied into the
   gesture interactive diagnosis of coronary heart disease and the
   diagnosis of the vascular stenosis are intuitively and naturally
   realized with augmented reality and gesture interactive techniques.
   Results: The number of states of dynamic gesture is determined by using
   wavelet transform which precisely detect singular points of gesture
   trajectory. The recognition rate of dynamic gesture is average of 96.1\%
   and the semi-dynamic gesture is average of 92.6\%, the total recognition
   rate is average of 95.6\%. The dynamic gesture recognition rate of the
   proposed method is 7\% higher than the traditional method. The intuitive
   and natural gesture interactive experiments and the affirmed measuring
   results are approved by surgeons.
   Conclusions: The proposed method is a feasible, usable and reliable
   gesture interactive diagnostic method for coronary heart disease based
   on wavelet transform and Semi-continuous Hidden Markov Model in
   Augmented Reality. The results demonstrate that the proposed method
   could improve the gesture recognition rate, extend the gesture
   manipulation space and expand the diagnostic method for coronary heart
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Educators must address several challenges inherent to the instruction of
   scientific disciplines such as physics - expensive or insufficient
   laboratory equipment, equipment error, difficulty in simulating certain
   experimental conditions. Augmented reality (AR) can be a promising
   approach to address these challenges. In this paper, we discuss the
   design and implementation of an AR and motion-sensing learning
   technology that teaches magnetic fields in a junior high school physics
   course. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of using
   natural interaction on students' physics learning and deep understanding
   compared to traditional learning tools. The 38 eighth graders who
   participated in this study were assigned to either an experimental group
   or a control group. Analysis of the results shows that the AR-based
   motion-sensing software can improve students' learning attitude and
   learning outcome. This study provides a case for the application of AR
   technology in secondary physics education.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual reality (VR) learning environments can provide students with
   concepts of the simulated phenomena, but users are not allowed to
   interact with real elements. Conversely, augmented reality (AR) learning
   environments blend real-world environments so AR could enhance the
   effects of computer simulation and promote students' realistic
   experience. However, AR-based learning environments had a lot of dynamic
   real objects which may increase learners' mental effort. Moreover,
   paucity of research compared AR with VR and other mature technologies.
   Thus, the aim of this study is to compare the influence of the 2D
   imagebased VR and AR in an inquiry-based astronomy course. The findings
   of this study suggested that the real objects presented in the AR system
   could reduce the mental load because students could take the real
   objects of the AR system as the reference objects of the movement of the
   moon. Furthermore, the sense of the immediacy is increased due to the
   fact that peers appear on the AR system. Accordingly, the real objects
   and the sense of the immediacy not only enhance the learning
   motivations, but also encourage the students to keep conducting the
   tasks.}},

Pages = {{6-20}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a design framework to support science education
   through blended learning, based on a participatory and interactive
   approach supported by ICT-based tools, called Science Learning
   Activities Model (SLAM). The development of this design framework
   started as a response to complex changes in society and education (e. g.
   high turnover rate of knowledge, changing labour market), which require
   a more creative response of learners to the world problems that surround
   them. Many of these challenges are related to science and it would be
   expected that students are attracted to science, however the contrary is
   the case. One of the origins of this disinterest can be found in the way
   science is taught. Therefore, after reviewing the relevant literature we
   propose the SLAM framework as a tool to aid the design of science
   courses with high motivational impact on students. The framework is
   concerned with the assumption that science learning activities should be
   applicable and relevant to contemporary life and transferable to
   `real-world' situations. The design framework proposes three design
   dimensions: context, technology and pedagogy, and aims at integrating
   learning in formal and informal contexts through blended learning
   scenarios by using today's flexible, interactive and immersive
   technologies (e. g. mobile, augmented reality, virtual reality).}},

Abstract = {{Disaster education focusing on how we should take immediate actions
   after disasters strike is essential to protect our lives. However,
   children find it difficult to understand such disaster education.
   Instead of disaster education to children, adults should properly
   instruct them to take immediate actions in the event of a disaster. We
   refer to such adults as Immediate-Action Commanders (IACers) and attach
   importance to technology-enhanced IACer training programs with high
   situational and audio-visual realities. To realize such programs, we
   focused on digital game, augmented reality (AR) and head-mounted
   displays (HMDs). We prototyped three AR systems that superimpose
   interactive virtual objects onto HMDs' real-time vision or a trainee's
   actual view based on interactive fictional scenarios. In addition, the
   systems are designed to realize voice-based interactions between the
   virtual objects (i.e., virtual children) and the trainee. According to a
   brief comparative survey, the AR system equipped with a smartphone-based
   binocular opaque HMD (Google Cardboard) has the most promising practical
   system for technology-enhanced IACer training programs.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates the social learning affordances of a
   room-sized, immersive, and interactive augmented reality simulation
   environment designed to support children's understanding of basic
   physics concepts in a science center. Conversations between 97
   parent-child pairs were analyzed in relation to categories of talk
   through which children's activities are structured, and their physical
   and perceptual experiences are related to scientific content knowledge.
   We provide a detailed account of how parents guide children's scientific
   reasoning in this novel learning environment, such as by structuring the
   exploration, and emphasizing perceptual observations as evidence and
   data. We argue that this particular type of interactive environment
   affords activities that support learning of complex ideas in science,
   empowering parents to provide support to the children's perceptual focus
   and physical engagement. Our findings contrast with studies on
   high-interactive immersive environments that have typically shown that
   children tend to isolate themselves from their social surroundings.
   Mixed-reality environments, in contrast, appear to support significant
   social interaction, while still offering children playful and engaging
   experiences.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a mobile Augmented Reality system, called
   DiedricAR, aimed at the learning of Descriptive Geometry. Thanks to its
   ability to recreate virtual models in real space, Augmented Reality is a
   technology suitable for making Descriptive Geometry comprehension and

   learn in autonomously way by using their own mobile devices (smartphones
   and tablets), that work as Augmented Reality displays over training
   material (DiedricAR exercise workbook) specially designed for the new
   learning model defined by the European Higher Education System. Compared
   to some of the existing Augmented Reality systems used to learn
   Descriptive Geometry, DiedricAR offers the advantage of being
   specifically developed for mobile devices giving the students the
   possibility of using ubiquitous learning to its ultimate extent by
   interacting with the didactical content (i.e. showing the desired
   intermediate step when solving dihedral exercises). The presentation of
   DiedricAR is completed by exploring some key items such as the potential
   benefits for students' spatial ability, the relationship between
   application design and user experience, and software performance on

Abstract = {{Computer hardware and mobile devices have developed rapidly in recent
   years, and augmented reality (AR) technology has been increasingly
   applied in mobile learning. Although instructional AR applications have
   yielded satisfactory results and prompted students' curiosity and
   interest, a number of problems remain. The crucial topic for AR
   applications is the lack of appropriate instructional scaffolds to help
   students organize the content to be learned. Moreover, a lack of
   appropriate instructional activities and scaffolds often results in
   student confusion and frustration. Therefore, we integrated AR with
   concept maps to form a concept-mapped AR (CMAR) scaffold. Subsequently,
   whether CMAR improves learning outcomes, motivation, and attitude in
   mobile learning activities was determined. An empirical study was
   conducted on 71 fifth-grade elementary students in Southern Taiwan. The
   students were divided into CMAR and AR system groups. The results showed
   that students in the CMAR group performed significantly better than
   those in the AR group. The student interview results also showed that
   the CMAR system helped students organize what they wanted to learn.}},

Abstract = {{We present CubeBuilder, a system for interactive, tangible 3D shape
   modeling. CubeBuilder allows the user to create a digital 3D model by
   placing physical, non-interlocking cubic blocks. These blocks may be
   placed in a completely arbitrary fashion and combined with other
   objects. In effect, this turns the task of 3D modeling into a playful
   activity that hardly requires any learning on the part of the user. The
   blocks are registered using a depth camera and entered into the cube
   graph where each block is a node and adjacent blocks are connected by
   edges. From the cube graph, we transform the initial cubes into coherent
   structures by generating smooth connection geometry for some edges of
   the graph. Based on an analysis of the cube graph, we identify subgraphs
   that match given graph templates. These subgraph templates map to
   predefined geometric refinements of the basic shape. This, in turn,
   allows the user to tangibly build structures of greater details than the
   blocks provide in and of themselves. We show a number of shapes that
   have been modeled by users and are indicative of the expressive power of
   the system. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of the tangible
   interface which appears to be limited only by the number of blocks
   available. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Building construction education is crucial in ensuring university
   students are adequately knowledgeable and competent to meet industry
   demands. Attributable to the changeable and complex environment,
   traditional pedagogical methods in building construction courses cannot
   equip students with concrete experience and knowledge. Despite several
   studies, adapting information and communication technology (ICT) tools
   such as virtual reality (VR) to enhance construction education, limited
   interaction and low detail of virtual contents still remain an unsolved
   issue. To address this problem, this study proposes an interactive
   building anatomy modeling (IBAM) system, which allows students to
   conveniently interact with VR environment for experiential building
   construction education. The IBAM system is developed based on the
   medical anatomy concept, including intuitive features, which support
   detaching and attaching components; and dissecting which enhances
   student-model interaction. To identify the advantages and limitations of
   IBAM, a prototype was developed, and its applicability was verified
   through a case study. Interim results suggest that the system
   facilitates experiential learning and provides adequate levels of
   interaction to effectively transfer knowledge to learners.}},

Abstract = {{Fully articulated hand tracking promises to enable fundamentally new
   interactions with virtual and augmented worlds, but the limited accuracy
   and efficiency of current systems has prevented widespread adoption.
   Today's dominant paradigm uses machine learning for initialization and
   recovery followed by iterative model-fitting optimization to achieve a
   detailed pose fit. We follow this paradigm, but make several changes to
   the model-fitting, namely using: (1) a more discriminative objective
   function; (2) a smooth-surface model that provides gradients for
   non-linear optimization; and (3) joint optimization over both the model
   pose and the correspondences between observed data points and the model
   surface. While each of these changes may actually increase the cost per
   fitting iteration, we find a compensating decrease in the number of
   iterations. Further, the wide basin of convergence means that fewer
   starting points are needed for successful model fitting. Our system runs
   in real-time on CPU only, which frees up the commonly over-burdened GPU
   for experience designers. The hand tracker is efficient enough to run on
   low-power devices such as tablets. We can track up to several meters
   from the camera to provide a large working volume for interaction, even
   using the noisy data from current-generation depth cameras. Quantitative
   assessments on standard datasets show that the new approach exceeds the
   state of the art in accuracy. Qualitative results take the form of live
   recordings of a range of interactive experiences enabled by this new
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{The present study compares the highly interactive cloud-classroom (HIC)
   system with traditional methods of teaching materials science that
   utilize crystal structure picture or real crystal structure model, in
   order to examine its learning effectiveness across three dimensions:
   knowledge, comprehension and application. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the (HIC) system, which incorporates augmented reality, virtual
   reality and cloud-classroom to teach basic materials science courses.
   The study followed a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental research
   design. A total of 92 students (aged 19-20 years), in a second-year
   undergraduate program, participated in this 18-week-long experiment. The
   students were divided into an experimental group and a control group.
   The experimental group (36 males and 10 females) was instructed
   utilizing the HIC system, while the control group (34 males and 12
   females) was led through traditional teaching methods. Pretest,
   posttest, and delayed posttest scores were evaluated by multivariate
   analysis of covariance. The results indicated that participants in the
   experimental group who used the HIC system outperformed the control
   group, in the both posttest and delayed posttest, across three learning
   dimensions. Based on these results, the HIC system is recommended to be
   incorporated in formal materials science learning settings.}},

Abstract = {{Anatomy education is a challenging but vital element in forming future
   medical professionals. In this work, a personalized and interactive
   augmented reality system is developed to facilitate education. This
   system behaves as a magic mirror which allows personalized in-situ
   visualization of anatomy on the user's body. Real-time volume
   visualization of a CT dataset creates the illusion that the user can
   look inside their body. The system comprises a RGB-D sensor as a
   real-time tracking device to detect the user moving in front of a
   display. In addition, the magic mirror system shows text information,
   medical images, and 3D models of organs that the user can interact with.
   Through the participation of 7 clinicians and 72 students, two user
   studies were designed to respectively assess the precision and
   acceptability of the magic mirror system for education. The results of
   the first study demonstrated that the average precision of the augmented
   reality overlay on the user body was 0.96 cm, while the results of the
   second study indicate 86.1\% approval for the educational value of the
   magic mirror, and 91.7\% approval for the augmented reality capability
   of displaying organs in three dimensions. The usefulness of this unique
   type of personalized augmented reality technology has been demonstrated

Abstract = {{An antagonistic relationship is traditionally seen as existing between
   eco-education and technology, with conventional instructional approaches
   usually characterized by a commentator guiding students in field
   learning. Unfortunately, in this passive learning approach, the
   discovery of rich ecological resources in eco-environments to stimulate
   positive emotions and experiences is often condensed into a
   ``sightseeing{''}. Therefore, precise and systematic guidance focused on
   providing a rich learning experience is needed in field learning and
   eco-education. Based on Kolb's experiential learning theory, the current
   study develops an eco-discovery AR-based learning model (EDALM) which is
   implemented in an eco-discovery AR-based learning system (EDALS). In a
   field experiment at a botanical garden, 21 middle school students
   constitute three groups participated in a learning activity using
   different learning types and media. Quantitative results indicate that,
   compared to the human-guidance-only model, EDALS successfully stimulates
   positive emotions and improved learning outcomes among learners. In
   post-activity interviews, students indicated they found the exploration
   mode provided by the proposed system to be more interesting and helpful
   to their learning in school. The use of attractive technologies increase
   students' willingness not only to learn more about the environment, but
   also to develop a more positive emotional attachment to it. (C) 2016

   transform learning. By digitally adding or removing information from the
   physical world, AR creates a sense that real and virtual objects
   coexist, and can enhance people's interactions both with each other and
   with objects in the world. Most museum implementations of AR have been
   in the realms of art and history. Using examples from across formal and
   informal settings, this article illustrates the learning affordances of
   AR for museums that aim to communicate concepts related to human health.
   These topics often present spatiotemporal challenges for learning, but
   can be made more accessible to learners when contextualized within
   personally, socially, and culturally relevant contexts. After briefly
   reviewing research on learning with AR, the article examines how museum
   designers might leverage AR's capacity for spatial and temporal
   representation, narrative and interactivity, real-time personalized
   scaffolds, and collaboration, to create meaningful learning experiences
   on medicine and human biology. The article ends with a discussion of
   issues related to the use of AR in museums, and thoughts on future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Many traditional approaches to clinical education today are outdated and
   inefficient with disruptive changes on the horizon. Millennials are the
   new wave of learners in health care and do not learn the same way as
   their older faculty. Merging health care systems are moving to
   standardizations of care and reduction of errors, and health care
   providers are going to be increasingly held more accountable for their
   clinical outcomes. Computers, digitalization, and connectivity are
   revolutionizing learning environments, and simulation learning in the
   form of trainers, mannequins, and team training is already widespread.
   Newer technologies like virtual and augmented reality are beginning to
   be used for clinical education and will be a more efficient and
   standardized way of providing simulation learning. Emerging technologies
   like holograms and head-mounted displays will follow soon after and be
   even more disruptive. Faculty and mentors will always be crucial to
   learning in health care but will be empowered to teach in more focused
   and comprehensive ways. The educational model of the future will be a
   hybrid model of experienced faculty, interactive learning, and
   innovative and emerging technology. It is time we start to train health
   care providers for their future, not our past.}},

Abstract = {{Education about green energy, such as understanding of principles and
   applications of solar energy or wind power, is a crucial topic in
   general science courses. The course unit for the process development of
   energy-related materials includes topics that are complex and abstract,
   such as the principle of the n-type, and p-type semiconductors, or
   photoconductive effects in solar cells, thus hindering the learning
   process of learners who do not specialize in this field, when they read
   related books and attempt to understand physical and chemical phenomena.
   To assist such learners in enhancing their learning effectiveness, this
   study used an augmented reality-based learning (ARBL) method and virtual
   reality technology to help learners comprehend green energy. Through
   ARBL integrated with virtual reality technology, learners were presented
   with various types of visual media (including web pages, text and
   pictures, animations, videos, and interactive games) while they learn
   about the related green energy knowledge. Such visual presentations were
   used to illustrate the operating principles for the process development
   of solar energy production, reduce the number of abstract words, and
   enhance learner comprehension. In addition, a global positioning system
   (GPS) was integrated into ARBL to guide learners in visiting locations
   where green energy equipment (e.g., solar street lights) is used.
   Through observations, reflections, and cloud recording, learners
   documented the strengths and limitations of green energy use and
   proposed related application methods and innovative ideas. In cloud
   recording, text mining technology (Pang and Lee) and a word cloud (Cui
   et al.) were adopted to summarize crucial points and assist learners in
   understanding critical problems. Group discussion was conducted for
   learners to share their learning approaches, observations, and findings,
   thereby enhancing their learning effectiveness. The results of this
   study demonstrated that learners strongly accepted ARBL and were highly
   satisfied with this learning approach. Conclusions drawn in this study
   can serve as a reference for educators and educational institutions in
   designing courses.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a study which demonstrates the advantages of using
   virtual-reality-based systems for training automotive assembly tasks.
   Sixty participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three
   training experiences to learn a car service procedure: (1) observational
   training through video instruction; (2) an experiential virtual training
   and trial in a CAVE; and (3) an experiential virtual training and trial
   through a portable 3D interactive table. Results show that virtual
   trained participants, after the training, can remember significantly
   better (p < .05) the correct execution of the steps compared to
   video-trained trainees. No significant differences were identified
   between the experiential groups neither in terms of post-training
   performances nor in terms of proficiency, despite differences in the
   interaction devices. The relevance of the outcomes for the automotive
   fields and for the designers of virtual training applications are
   discussed in light of the outcomes, particularly that virtual training
   experienced through a portable device such as the interactive table can
   be effective, as can training performed in a CAVE. This suggests the
   possibility for automotive industries to invest in advanced portable
   hardware to deliver effectively long-distance programs of training for
   car service operators placed all over the world.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Technology allowing a remote, experienced surgeon to provide
   real-time guidance to local surgeons has great potential for training
   and capacity building in medical centers worldwide. Virtual interactive
   presence and augmented reality (VIPAR), an iPad-based tool, allows
   surgeons to provide long-distance, virtual assistance wherever a
   wireless internet connection is available. Local and remote surgeons
   view a composite image of video feeds at each station, allowing for
   intraoperative telecollaboration in real time.
   METHODS: Local and remote stations were established in Ho Chi Minh City,
   Vietnam, and Birmingham, Alabama, as part of ongoing neurosurgical
   collaboration. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus
   coagulation with VIPAR was used for subjective and objective evaluation
   of system performance.
   RESULTS: VIPAR allowed both surgeons to engage in complex visual and
   verbal communication during the procedure. Analysis of 5 video clips
   revealed video delay of 237 milliseconds (range, 93-391 milliseconds)
   relative to the audio signal. Excellent image resolution allowed the
   remote neurosurgeon to visualize all critical anatomy. The remote
   neurosurgeon could gesture to structures with no detectable difference
   in accuracy between stations, allowing for submillimeter precision.
   Fifteen endoscopic third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus coagulation
   procedures have been performed with the use of VIPAR between Vietnam and
   the United States, with no significant complications. 80\% of these
   patients remain shunt-free.
   CONCLUSION: Evolving technologies that allow longdistance,
   intraoperative guidance, and knowledge transfer hold great potential for
   highly efficient international neurosurgical education. VIPAR is one
   example of an inexpensive, scalable platform for increasing global
   neurosurgical capacity. Efforts to create a network of Vietnamese
   neurosurgeons who use VIPAR for collaboration are underway.}},

Abstract = {{This study focused on how to enhance the interactivity and usefulness of
   augmented reality (AR) by integrating manipulative interactive tools
   with a real-world environment. A manipulative AR (MAR) system, which
   included 3D interactive models and manipulative aids, was designed and
   developed to teach the unit Understanding Weather in a natural science
   course, and to bridge a formal learning environment (i.e. school),
   non-formal (i.e. at a museum), and informal learning environments (i.e.
   home). Sixty-four sixth-grade students (12-13 years old) from four
   classes in Taipei City were enrolled in a seven-week general studies
   course entitled Natural and Life Science and Technology, and they were
   divided into an experimental group (31 students who used the MAR system)
   and a control group (33 students who used multimedia teaching
   resources). After seven weeks of experiments, the results revealed that
   integrating the MAR system into inquiry-based field study made a greater
   positive impact on the students' academic achievement and motivation
   compared to the multimedia teaching resources installed on a tablet PC.
   Additionally, there were two interesting findings: (1) the MAR system
   offered effective learning materials relative to the multimedia teaching
   resources and (2) manipulative aids were an effective learning tool for
   interactivity and usefulness of AR. Besides, there were two meaningful
   suggestions associated with designing and developing the AR educational
   system for future researchers and designers, namely make it easy to use
   and include manipulative aids.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented Reality (AR) is the process of overlaying meaningful
   interactive information in a live video stream for creating an enriched
   visual experience for users. Within Remote Access Laboratories (RAL)
   this enables users to gain design experience along with gaining
   knowledge about the particular experiment in question and potentially
   collaborate on design experiences. This paper focuses on the issues
   related to the applications of AR in RAL, the levels of AR in context of
   RAL and their effect on the learning tools. This paper also discusses
   the challenges of integrating a Natural User interface into the AR for
   RAL experiments. Finally it presents two example applications for AR in
   RAL experiment - Virtual Objects Creation and Object Identification and
   Tagging.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of digital museum interactives as a widely available
   learning offer in all types of museums, including history of art and
   archaeology museums, an ongoing debate has been established: Do these
   usually screen-based-museum interactives assist visitors in focusing on
   museum objects and artefacts? Or do they distract and take away the
   attention from the real museum objects on display? We present the Loupe,
   a tangible Augmented Reality prototype in form of a magnifying lens,
   which allows museum visitors to get information in context about museum
   artefacts. We detail the design and content creation process that was
   employed in order to create a thematic tour for the Greek Gallery of
   Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam. An evaluation study with 22 adult
   participants was carried out, using both qualitative and quantitative
   evaluation methods, so as to explore the utility and usability of the
   Loupe as well its learning and affective impact. Our findings suggest
   that the acceptance of the Loupe as a museum interactive and learning
   resource, was related both with its qualities as a tangible as well as
   with the structure of the content and the narratives revealed.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{186-201}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Evacuation drills should be more realistic and interactive.
   Focusing on situational and audio-visual realities and scenario-based
   interactivity, the authors have developed a game-based evacuation drill
   (GBED) system that presents augmented reality (AR) materials on tablet
   computers. The paper's current research purpose is to improve visual
   reality (AR materials) in our GBED system.
   Design/methodology/approach - The author's approach is to develop a new
   GBED system that superimposes digital objects {[}e.g. three-dimensional
   computer graphics (3DCG) elements] onto real-time vision using a
   marker-based AR library, a binocular opaque head-mounted display (HMD)
   and other current easily available technologies.
   Findings - The findings from a trial experiment are that the new GBED
   system can improve visual reality and is appropriate for disaster
   education. However, a few problems remain for practical use.
   Research limitations/implications - When using the GBED system,
   participants (i.e. HMD wearers) can suffer from 3D sickness and have
   difficulty in moving. These are important safety problems in HMD-based
   systems.
   Social implications - The combination of AR and HMDs for GBEDs (i.e.
   integrating virtual and real worlds) will raise questions about its
   merits (pros and cons).
   Originality/value - The originality of the research is the combination
   of AR and an HMD to a GBED, which has previously been realized primarily
   as simulation games in virtual worlds. The authors believe that our
   research has the potential to expand disaster education.}},

Journal = {{INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS}},

Pages = {{1245-1264}},
Abstract = {{The learning of plants has garnered considerable attention in recent
   years, but students often lack the motivation to learn about the process
   of plant growth. Also, students are not able to apply what they have
   learned in class in the form of observation, since plant growth takes a
   long time. In this study, we use augmented reality (AR) technology to
   develop the ARFlora system, which can assist students in observing the
   changes in plant growth while in the classroom. More specifically,
   students are able to use AR markers to manipulate various virtual
   objects (e.g. sunlight) and observe the changes they have on plant
   growth. Meanwhile, a quasi-experimental evaluation is in place to
   substantiate the effectiveness of ARFlora in the learning of plants and
   to compare it with digital video learning. In the quasi-experimental
   design, 55 elementary-school students participated in the study. The
   participants are divided into two groups, an ``experimental group{''}
   and a ``control group.{''} The experimental group was taught using the
   ARFlora system, while the control group was taught by employing the
   digital video. Results show that (1) ARFlora and digital video have the
   same effectiveness on student's learning outcomes; (2) ARFlora is more
   effective in helping students retain learned knowledge; and (3) ARFlora
   is comparatively more useful in motivating students to learn about
   plants.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research is to develop a hands-on spatial geometry
   learning system to facilitate the learning of geometry. The development
   of this system was based on Duval's four critical elements of geometric
   learning: perceptual apprehension, sequential apprehension, operative
   apprehension, and discursive apprehension. The system offers support to
   high school students in the process of spatial geometry problem-solving.
   It provides a hands-on approach for manipulating spatial figures,
   thereby developing the students' visualization skills and ability to
   conceptualize images. The experiment comprised a total of 58
   participants from different classes with the experimental group using
   the proposed learning system, whereas the control group using the
   traditional pencil-and-paper approach. The study investigated the
   effects of the hands-on system on the perceptual, sequential, and
   operative apprehension, and on overall spatial geometry scores and
   learning attitude. The results indicated improvements on effective
   learning and a higher level of sequential, operative apprehension, and
   overall spatial geometry scores from the experimental group.}},

Abstract = {{Gestural interaction devices emerged and originated various studies on
   multimodal human-computer interaction to improve user experience (UX).
   However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the use of these devices to
   enhance learning. We present an exploratory study which analysed the UX
   with a multimodal immersive videogame prototype, based on a Portuguese
   historical/cultural episode. Evaluation tests took place in high school
   environments and public videogaming events. Two users would be present
   simultaneously in the same virtual reality (VR) environment: one as the
   helmsman aboard Vasco da Gama's fifteenth-century Portuguese ship and
   the other as the mythical Adamastor stone giant at the Cape of Good
   Hope. The helmsman player wore a VR headset to explore the environment,
   whereas the giant player used body motion to control the giant, and
   observed results on a screen, with no headset. This allowed a
   preliminary characterisation of UX, identifying challenges and potential
   use of these devices in multi-user virtual learning contexts. We also
   discuss the combined use of such devices, towards future development of
   similar systems, and its implications on learning improvement through

Abstract = {{Shaping children's experience, enhancing their imagination and affecting
   their behaviors, toys have great importance. Recently, toys have gained
   a digital characteristic and many children have tended to use them. For
   this reason, educational magic toys (EMT) were developed with augmented
   reality technology in this study. It is called as EMT because virtual
   objects such as story animations, 3D objects and flash animations appear
   on the toys. EMT has included puzzles, flash cards and match cards to
   teach animals, fruits, vegetables, vehicles, objects, professions,
   colors, numbers and shapes for average 5-6 age children in Early
   Childhood Education. The aim of this study is to reveal teachers' and
   children's opinions on EMT, to determine children's behavioral patterns
   and their cognitive attainment, and the relationship between them while
   playing EMT. Mix method was used and the sample consisted of 30 teachers
   and 33 children aged 5-6 in early childhood education. As data
   collection tools, a survey, an observation and interview form were used.
   This study revealed that teachers and children liked EMT activity. In
   addition, children interactively played with these toys but not had high
   cognitive attainment. From this point, we can say that these toys can be
   effectively used in early childhood education. However, collaborative
   and interactive learning with these toys should be provided. Moreover,
   this study will provide an important contribution, present a new
   educational AR application, and fill the gap in the educational
   technology field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{123-146}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aims to show the relevance of augmented reality
   (AR) in mobile learning for the 21st century. With AR, any real-world
   environment can be augmented by providing users with accurate digital
   overlays. AR is a promising technology that has the potential to
   encourage learners to explore learning materials from a totally new
   perspective. Besides, the advancements made in information technology
   further broaden the scope for educational AR applications. Furthermore,
   the proliferation of wireless mobile devices such as smartphones and
   tablets is also introducing AR into the mobile domain.
   Design/methodology/approach - This discussion paper gives an insight of
   the different potential fields of application of AR and eventually
   proposes an AR application that will give a completely different
   learning experience for learners. This AR mobile application will not
   only provide learners with supplementary information but will also
   assist lecturers in their teaching process. There are certain concepts
   in computer science at the tertiary level that are at times difficult
   for learners to understand using the traditional classroom approach.
   Through this AR application developed, the learners are able to see what
   is happening and experience a different form of learning where the focus
   is more on ``learning by doing{''} and on the ability of visualizing the
   complete set of steps involved for a particular operation. Finally what
   is proposed is a generic framework/process for the development of AR
   applications for learning purposes.
   Findings - The AR application developed and tested has proved to be
   helpful in understanding complex concepts of computer science that
   average students have much difficulty in understanding. Through AR,
   learning has been brought to a new dimension where the students can
   easily visualize what is happening and easily understand complex
   concepts. This low-cost system that has been proposed can track and
   detect both markerless and marker-based images. A number of experiments
   have also been carried out to determine a set of best practices for the
   development and use of such AR applications.
   Originality/value - Learners have been able to have a more interactive
   and enriching learning experience through two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional digital augmentations. The AR mobile application has
   been enhancing the cognitive skills of learners through enabling them to
   scan images from printed materials with their smartphones. Then,
   informative digital augmentation has been overlaid in real time on the
   mobile screen with the image preview still in the background.}},

   topics is analyzed. With regard to the studies conducted in Taiwan
   during the period 2003-2012, the researchers placed more emphasis on
   mobile technologies to strengthen the web-based learning of science.
   Educational games, augmented reality (AR) technologies, and audience
   response systems (ARS) have gradually been utilized to support
   interactive learning environments. The selected studies preferred to
   adopt a quantitative approach with (quasi-) experimental settings in the
   design of their research. As for the research topics, the researchers
   showed major interest in the learning environment and students'
   motivation. The derived suggestions and potential implications for
