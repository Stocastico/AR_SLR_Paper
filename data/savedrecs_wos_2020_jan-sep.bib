Abstract = {{Risks of work-related musculoskeletal injuries can be reduced by
   adequately training construction workers on performing work in safe
   postures. Traditional training approaches provide limited support for
   performing work tasks and receiving real-time feedback. This paper
   describes a cyber-physical postural training environment where workers
   can practice to perform work with reduced ergonomic risks. The proposed
   system uses wearable sensors, Vive trackers, machine learning and
   virtual reality to track body kinematics, and engagement with physical
   construction resources, and provides feedback via an interactive user
   interface. The postural training system was developed for training
   workers engaged in wood frame construction. User study of the
   effectiveness of the feedback and user interface was conducted. Findings
   showed that the user interface was perceived as convenient with limited
   interference with the workspace. The feedback was understandable in
   learning risks associated with participant's postures. Further research
   will involve conducting formative workload evaluation of the user
   interface and developing a reinforcement learning model for adapting the
   feedback based on the state of learning.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{In a period of rapid adaptation to technology in today's world, limiting
   education to traditional methods leads to a rapid decline in the
   perception and interest of the learner. Augmented Reality (AR), which is
   among the most interesting technological innovation of the last years,
   are manifested in many sectors. It is used more widely in the field of
   education thanks to its superior advantages such as being portable,
   adapting to different devices/equipment, offering interactive digital
   content and arousing interest. In this study, AR application has been
   realized for the modeling of N-type MOSFET element, which is one of the
   basic courses of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and is widely
   used in analog and digital circuits. The contribution of the application
   to students' perception of theoretical concepts was also examined. It
   concluded that AR made an important contribution to the concretization
   of abstract concepts and the developed educational material increased
   the motivation of the students.}},

Journal = {{ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{Despite an increase in the use of technology in undergraduate anatomy
   education, and the rising popularity of online anatomy courses at

   augmented reality is an effective and engaging tool for learning anatomy
   in community college students. Participants recruited from Cuyahoga
   Community College (Cleveland, OH) studied skull anatomy using either
   traditional tools (i.e., textbook and plastic skull model) or an
   augmented reality head-mounted display with an interactive virtual skull
   application. Comparison of knowledge before and following the study
   period revealed that augmented reality was an effective tool for
   learning skull anatomy: pre-quiz = 32.7\% (+/- 25.2); mean (+/- SD),
   post-quiz = 61.8\% (+/- 19.5); n = 15; t((28))= 3.53;P = 0.001. The

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{To explore the design of the virtual reality (VR) augmented reality (AR)
   mobile platform and game decision model based on deep learning (DL), the
   gesture-based interaction of VR games based on Leap Motion is
   researched. Based on the interactive features of gestures, a set of
   general gesture interaction rules in VR games is established. In the
   meantime, according to the theoretical basis and the characteristics of
   VR, a set of general models of VR gesture interaction is designed, the
   factors affecting the efficiency of VR gesture interaction are studied,
   and reasonable interaction feedback is designed. By using the computer
   vision and image processing technology, gesture-based interaction can
   collect natural gestures, extract gesture features, recognize gesture
   indications, and respond to the user demands. Also, it can extract the
   basic gestures from gesture-based interaction in VR, analyze the basic
   features of gestures and gesture-based interaction in VR games, and
   describes the gesture features by mathematical vectors and sets. The
   research results show that the application of gesture feature design
   method in the game can analyze the factors affecting the interaction
   efficiency. Also, the usability of the gesture-based interaction
   designed by the gesture design method is verified by tests. Therefore,
   the AR\&DL platform of ``AR+DL{''} establishes a learning platform
   supported by DL and AR technology. The game decision model is used to

Abstract = {{In a world engaged in a perpetual race for progress, augmented reality
   (AR) is a new frontier that has attracted much research attention in
   recent years. The generalization of smartphones and the miniaturization
   and democratization of connected gadgets are leading to new uses and new
   expectations. In this article, we provide an AR application to the
   trending educational activity of escape games in order to diffuse AR to
   a large audience. As the application of an educational escape game,
   which is a good tool to improve the motivation and communication skills
   of students, requires considerable time for design, manufacturing, and
   operating, a numeric, mobile AR version is proposed here. For this
   purpose, an original paper-based version of the scenario is presented,
   principally turning around the Solvay process for a high school/college
   audience. In this scenario, the students are led to follow in the
   footsteps of a young Belgian physicist, Ernest Solvay. Through enigmas,
   participants discover a secret room containing Solvay's secrets in
   Brussels. Puzzles about the periodic table of elements, the CPK color
   code, chemical reaction balancing, the notion of molar mass, the Solvay
   process, or the philanthropic conferences organized by Solvay and the
   many other scientists involved are used to illustrate the chemical
   process discovered. This scenario and the Leblanc process scenario have
   been adapted to an AR experience with the open application Metaverse.
   Unlike conventional escape game or escape lab activities, our AR escape
   games can be easily diffused to large audience classrooms without the
   presence of any teacher being required and without any systematic
   preparation. The advantages and limits of such tools are discussed. The
   feedback received from students that participated in a test exercise
   with the tool corroborates the increase of motivation through such
   activities.}},

   scenario with unlimited physical space. The results indicate that both
   game modes are intrinsically satisfactory for children triggering
   positive emotions such as enthusiasm, enjoyment and curiosity that
   improve the participants' mood and help increase the degree of
   involvement. Moreover, we observed that the collaborative game version
   has a greater impact on emotional affection, social interaction and

   communication in the collaborative mode is good in terms of several
   factors such as sustaining mutual understanding, dialogue management,

Abstract = {{Featured Application The system and the activities presented in this
   manuscript can be successfully employed for the empowerment of social
   abilities in pre-school children, promoting inclusion and preventing
   isolation. Potential applications are also the improvement of weak
   functions in the at-risk population (e.g., on children with
   neurodevelopmental disorders and children with language and
   communication disorders).
   Abstract Virtual reality (VR) creates computer-generated virtual
   environments where users can experience and interact in a similar way as
   they would do in real life. VR systems are increasingly being used for
   rehabilitation goals, mainly with adults, but also with children,
   extending their application to the educational field. This report
   concerns a study of the impact of a semi-immersive VR system in a group
   of 25 children in a kindergarten context. The children were involved in
   several different games and activity types, specifically developed with
   the aim of learning specific skills and foster team collaboration. Their
   reactions and behaviors were recorded by their teachers and by trained
   psychologists through observation grids addressing task comprehension,
   participation and enjoyment, interaction and cooperation, conflict,
   strategic behaviors, and adult-directed questions concerning the
   activity, the device or general help requests. The grids were compiled
   at the initial, intermediate and final timepoint during each session.
   The results show that the activities are easy to understand, enjoyable,
   and stimulate strategic behaviors, interaction and cooperation, while
   they do not elicit the need for many explanations. These results are
   discussed within a neuroconstructivist educational framework and the
   suitability of semi-immersive, virtual-reality-based activities for
   cognitive empowerment and rehabilitation purposes is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors show that augmented reality technology has a
   positive impact on learning-related outcomes of middle-school Mexican
   students. However, the impact varies depending on whether students were
   enrolled in public or private schools.
   The authors designed an augmented reality application for students to
   practice the basic principles of geometry, and a similar application
   which encompasses identical learning objectives and content deployed in
   a Web-based learning environment. A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design was
   employed with 93 participants to investigate the effect of type of
   technology (web, augmented reality), type of school (private, public),
   and time of assessment (pre, post) on motivation, and declarative
   learning. The results show that: (1) there is an interactive effect of
   type of technology, type of school, and time of assessment when
   students' achievement scores are measured; (2) students using the
   augmented reality-based learning environments scored higher in post-test
   than those using the web-based application; (3) the augmented reality
   learning environment was more learning effective compared with the
   web-based learning environment in public schools, but not in private
   schools; (4) there is not an interactive effect of type of technology,
   type of school and time of assessment when students' motivation is
   measured; (5) students from private schools reported higher levels of
   motivation compared with those from public schools when using the
   augmented reality learning environment. The research findings imply that
   in Mexico, augmented reality technology can be exploited as an effective
   learning environment for helping middle-school students from public and
   private schools to practice the basic principles of Geometry.}},

Abstract = {{The use of augmented reality (AR) in vocational education and training
   can still be considered as being in its infancy, although interest in it
   is growing in response both to its potential for teaching and its
   adoption as a practical tool in various industry sectors. One example of
   early-stage AR use is illustrated from a practicum for training
   apprentices in the chemical industry; this involves the use of various
   AR objects for learning a simple production operation. Although this
   application had been conceived of purely in terms of substitution for
   existing instructional methods, it also gave learners greater control of
   the learning process and created opportunities for collaborative
   learning. Pedagogically, AR can be considered as a mildly disruptive
   technology that favours learner managed learning, a factor that is
   aligned with its ability to support localised decision-making in
   industry. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic
   Augmented reality (AR) tends to favour exploratory, learner managed and
   increasingly, collaborative learning. Evaluations of AR for vocational
   learning are on balance positive, with improved understanding, fewer
   errors and faster task completion or improved learning performance all
   reported. AR is still in the early stages of adoption in vocational
   education and training (VET), with trials and small-scale applications
   dominating. What this paper adds Introducing AR even for simple learning
   tasks affects the pedagogical approaches that are used. Effects include
   greater learner control of the learning process and encouragement of
   reflection-in-action. Implications for practice and/or policy AR is a
   mildly disruptive technology that needs to be considered in terms of its
   pedagogical implications as well as its effectiveness as a learning
   tool. The directions favoured by AR in education and training appear
   consistent with changing skill and learning demands in industry.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented Reality (AR) tends to merge the computing world with the real
   world, giving way to an incredible user experience. This field is not
   only limited to entertainment but has been utilized in various domains
   including healthcare, education and training. Realizing the potential of
   Augmented Reality in improving the learning experience, researchers have
   explored many ways of incorporating AR in the field education.
   Consequently, this research is focused on providing interactive and
   customized learning experience to book readers. We present a mobile
   application, Smart Learning Companion (SLAC), for physical books that
   provide a virtual content for a book. The virtual content includes, 3D
   animations, Quizzes, explanation of content in native language and many
   other features. The virtual content is activated as soon as pages are
   scanned with a mobile phone or tablet. Smart Learning Companion explains
   animated educational content and provides an interactive user
   experience. The aim of SLAC is to encourage students to learn on their
   own by making books more interactive. Smart Learning Companion provides
   explanation in Urdu, solutions of exercises with animations, quizzes for
   each section, and overall result that shows the student progress. This
   will help to reduce the dependency of students on others for learning
   making them capable of self-learning. Smart Learning Companion
   applications are developed for four books to conduct the experiments.
   Experimental study is conducted to show the effectiveness of Smart
   Learning Companion application. The results show that our application
   helped students to understand the concepts more easily as explanation
   was provided in national language of Pakistan, that is, Urdu.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the development of markerless Augmented Reality
   (AR) using ARCore platform, where interactive three-dimensional (3D)
   content was designed and developed based on the learning outcome
   syllabus to enhance the visualization and understanding of the anatomy

   method is based on 2D images and slides, plastic models and cadavers
   have to deal with students' experience issues such as lack of
   interactive, uneasy feeling with dead body and cadavers storing and
   donation. Therefore, more advances using technology such as Augmented
   Reality (AR) in learning method are needed to overcome the current gap
   and enhance the students' learning. Thus, this study aims to develop
   markerless AR specifically focus on the cardiovascular system for
   undergraduate physiotherapy program at UniKL, RCMP. In this study, we
   describe a method used to create markerless AR content using 3D data
   from MRI images and 3D unity as an authoring tool. We present three
   processes, where the first design consideration based on author's
   previous works derived from systematic search strategy were outlined,
   the second 3D model was developed using a real object and subsequently
   converted to an AR asset that can be linked to a unique markerless using
   ARCore platform and the third AR content creation using 3D unity
   authoring tool. This application provides a better visualization for the
   anatomical parts to support for an innovative and flexible learning
   process. We have successfully analyzed the design consideration using a
   systematic search strategy and developed the markerless AR specifically
   for cardiovascular system in anatomy and physiology courses. This study
   has contributed to knowledge in design and development of AR used in
   physiotherapy education. Therefore, this will be a step forward to an

Abstract = {{In the domain of education, an Intelligent Classroom that employs
   Ambient Intelligence technologies can not only improve learning and
   student performance, but also support educators with the various
   educational tasks, such as lecturing, course preparation and classroom
   management. Given that the board is one of the key artifacts of any
   classroom, using technology to enhance it offers students and educators
   rich opportunities by providing access to a wide range of applications,
   capturing and maintaining a simultaneous focus of attention for large
   learner groups, supporting collaboration and encouraging discussion. To
   this end, this work presents the CognitOS Classboard, an educator- and
   student- oriented framework, employed on the ``Intelligent Classroom
   Board{''} - a wall-to-wall projected interactive board- offering a
   variety of tools and applications aiming to support lecturing and

   fascinating learning experiences for the students, the CognitOS
   Classboard apart from offering access to useful educational
   applications, features sophisticated mechanisms that can transform the
   classroom into an immersive environment on demand. It supports
   multimodal interaction through touch, mid-air gestures, voice commands,
   and user position tracking, while a tablet and a desktop application

Abstract = {{Computer programming is a basic component of computer courses. In
   general, the study begins with programming logic and algorithms.
   Programming logic aims to develop logical reasoning for building
   computational algorithms. Already an algorithm consists of a set of
   steps ordered sequentially to solve a problem. Beginning students of
   computer courses often have difficulty interpreting problems and
   organizing the steps of an algorithm. Technological resources can be
   used in the classroom to assist in this process, such as interactive
   games, mobile applications, virtual and augmented reality applications,
   among others. In this context, this paper presents an augmented
   reality-based educational game proposal to help the teaching of
   programming logic. The game, for mobile devices, features a virtual
   environment for building algorithms commonly presented in the classroom.
   The game consists of a mobile app and a set of cards for augmented
   reality viewing. Three everyday problems are proposed for which the
   algorithm sequence of steps must be constructed. The problems are
   changing a light bulb, changing a car tire and making a cake. The game
   presents the problem statement and a virtual environment for building
   the algorithm. The virtual environment contains manipulable objects and
   action objects. Manipulable objects are tools, utensils, and
   ingredients, while action objects are used to perform actions on
   resources, such as picking, screwing, mixing, and so on. To solve the
   problem, the student needs to select the objects and drag them onto an
   object allocation mat, which represents the sequence of algorithm steps.
   The algorithm output is presented visually using augmented reality. It
   corresponds to a 3D animation representing a positive or negative
   result. To view the output, the student needs to position the phone
   camera on the problem card. If the algorithm is correct, a positive
   visual result will be displayed, such as a full and showy cake.
   Otherwise, an incomplete cake will be displayed. In addition, the
   application provides a pseudocode of the algorithm written in natural
   language. The results show that the technologies and features selected
   for the game development enable the creation of an interactive and
   accessible application through mobile devices. It is expected that the
   proposed game can be used as an aid in teaching programming logic in the
   classroom.}},

Abstract = {{Education, nowadays, is going through a transition process. ``New
   Students{''} require tools that allow them to improve their technical
   knowledge and, besides that, strengthen soft skills such as
   communication and teamwork. Developments that use Virtual Reality and
   Augmented Reality as a means for teaching have shown to have positive
   impacts on factors such as understanding, motivation and agility in the
   learning process of university students. In this article we describe the
   development of two tools, one based on Virtual Reality and one on
   Augmented Reality, to teach Multivariate Calculus to university
   students. The applications through experimentation and collaborative
   observation, allow them to understand concepts such as functions,
   quadratic surfaces, directional derivative, traces and contour lines.
   Both applications provide students and educators the change to
   experiment though digital environments used in a class in multivariate
   calculus. Each application includes two different roles: student and
   educator. The student is an observer. The professor and the students are
   represented through avatars that interact with each other. The educator
   role is more complex, allowing the user to create and modify functions
   and quadratic surfaces and create planes that intersect the surfaces
   that represent the functions.
   Students within the Virtual Reality environment experience ran the
   application on their phones. They used Virtual Reality glasses to
   immerse themselves in the experience and a remote Bluetooth controller
   to walk through the virtual environment. They were able to walk on and
   under the displayed mathematical functions. The instructor, on the other
   hand, created and modified those functions and directed the learning
   experience showing different interactions among planes and surfaces. The
   instructor ran the VR application on a computer.
   Meanwhile, students using the Augmented Reality application, were able
   to visualize functions and surfaces through the camera of their phones
   when pointing to the marker. Each student had the possibility of
   pointing to any place within the surface with a green dotted marker.
   They could also observe overlapping with the surfaces. The instructor
   had the same functionalities as in the virtual reality application.
   This study showed that almost all students encountered the experience
   satisfying and helpful. They thought it was revealing in many ways,
   allowing them to visualize abstract surfaces and traces easily. Also,
   some students pointed out their wish of including these experiences
   since the beginning of the course.
   In the full article, we plan to describe the creation of both VR and AR
   applications and provide data on the student perceptions.}},

Abstract = {{Rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases are a group of devastating
   autoimmune disorders that all share a common debilitating symptom
   fatigue. Fatigue is not widely understood and is often underrepresented
   in treatment regimes. Fatigue is the least successfully managed symptom
   of these conditions; however, it can often be the one of the greatest
   impairments.
   Augmented reality (AR) enhances a person's reality showing a hybrid
   environment where real and virtual objects coexist. Currently
   educational AR applications are saturating the application market, as
   they have shown great potential for increasing comprehension and
   understanding of complex concepts. AR expands user engagement by
   enhancing the learner's enjoyment and enriching their learning
   environment.
   This research explores the development and subsequent effect of an AR
   application on education around fatigue and basic neuroanatomy within
   the general population. The application was created using medical scan
   dataset, a variety of 3D modelling software and a game engine to create
   a functional and interactive augmented application. The application
   explores the effects of fatigue on a person's daily life while also
   laying a foundation of basic neuroanatomy. A pilot test conducted on 14
   participants (8 males, 5 females and 1 other), with ages ranged 16-64 (4
   form range 16 to 24, 5 from range 25 to 34, 1 from range 35 to 44, 3
   from range 45 to 54, 1 from 55 to 64), shows the application is highly
   usable, increases understanding of basic neuroanatomical concepts and
   has the potential to improve understanding of fatigue. Nonetheless,
   further development and testing of the application are imperative so
   that we can gain a better understanding of the usability of the
   application with wider audiences. Future developments will aim to
   further aid knowledge acquisition and enhance understanding of fatigue,
   a complex and widely misunderstood concept.}},
