abstract="The present research investigates the state-of-the-art concerning virtual and augmented reality lab environments, in science teaching and learning. Both environments are suggested as most appropriate for science education. The study explores the extent to which research has progressed concerning these new tools, while focusing on the extent to which actual educational trials in science classrooms have been completed. To this effect, 19 research papers were identified and reviewed. Conclusions are drawn as regards the effectiveness of these two lab environment types as a function of the age of students, today. The creation of educational VR and AR that resembles reality so closely that it is hard to differentiate between virtual, augmented, and real, thus creating a unified continuum, seems to finally be within our grasp, yet further research is needed as to their optimum use.",

abstract="It is commonly said that Augmented Reality opens new perspectives for training. Today, it is unlikely that the audit objectives will be met. One of the major criticisms of traditional computing is that the digital world of the computer is too disconnected from the real world in which users evolve. Mixed Reality (RM) focuses on interactive systems in which real objects and computer data are coherently merged. However, integrating these new tools into the existing learning processes remains complex, due to the technological aspects and the data continuum to be implemented, through the identification of use cases and the associated gains and by the diversity actors and experts to involve in this process: the expert of the main field, the designer and the IT developer. In this paper we aim to develop an augmented reality application by following a developing process that will led to the planned results. The proposed application will be dictated for learners in higher education context, especially newbies that will practice their first experiment in the laboratory e.g. ``biology, chemistry'' by giving them an interactive environment to understand the safety procedure followed during experiments in laboratories.",

abstract="Evermore widespread ``flipped classroom'' learning model is associated with increased independence of learning. The problem is the independence of learning math by students with visual impairments, especially the blind. Mathematical content includes spatial objects such as formulas and graphics, inaccessible to blind students and hardly accessible to low vision students. They prevent independent learning. The article presents a method that increases students' independence in recognising mathematical content in textbooks and worksheets. The method consists in introducing into the document elements of Augmented Reality (AR), that is texts and sounds extending information about the mathematical objects encountered in the content, beyond the information provided by WCAG guidelines and recommendations of the WAI-ARIA standard under development by the W3C consortium. Access to AR elements is gained through multi-sensual User Interface - hearing, the touch of a braille display, touch screen and touch gestures. The method was developed in cooperation with students with visual impairment and math teachers. It is currently undergoing valorisation in Poland, the Netherlands and Ireland.",

Through an analysis in a sample of children aged between 3 to 5 years, the advantages, disadvantages that the RA has over them in their cognitive advances with the experience of the objects are identified. Observation, experimental and inductive methods were used, as a result of the project, it was found that children love learning in a more practical, playful and positive way. The use of AR serves to motivate them and encourage them to learn in a meaningful, creative and animated way so that they can grasp and adopt learning as part of their environment.

abstract="Autism is a severe disorder affecting 1 in 160 children globally. Autism comprises of several development disabilities such as social, communicational and behavioural challenges. Children being diagnosed by the autism mainly face a hard time studying curriculum in inclusive classrooms based on their IQ level and the autism levels. Although, different strategies and learning teaching tools are available to support autistic children, only few systems aid them in learning efficiently, and are not highly interactive. Thus, the proposed Intelligent Education System primarily focuses on providing interactive learning experience to the autistic children with IQ level >50{\%} and efficient teaching assistance to their tutors using augmented reality and machine learning in both English and Arabic The capability of the education system to perform an action, allows the autistic child to interact with the playable sand and gain interest. In learning stage, once the child scribbles on the sandbox, Kinect 3D camera captures and recognizes the drawn image. After the refinement and recognition of the image using OpenCV and classification model, the stored set of real world object are projected on the canvas. Besides, a webcam captures the facial expression of the child, and emotion detection algorithm determines the reaction of the child. Based on the child's emotion, the current object is projected and pronounced three times to enforce better learning. Once the instructor chooses the language and character to be taught using the developed mobile application, the system displays it over the sandbox and further three objects that starts with the particular character are pronounced and projected. The system is tested rigorously with large set of users, and the results prove the efficiency of the system and happiness of the autistic children in better learning.",

abstract="This work focuses on the Augmented Reality trying to improve students' interaction and participation in the educational dialogue, preventing the drop out, tested with university mathematics courses. Students often have difficulties on some topics related to the transition between different representations, within the same representations and language, for example when dealing with the study of two-variable functions, but also about the exact differential forms and the identification of the domain to integrate a function of several variables. These difficulties lead to a decrease in interaction and participation, and sometimes to dropping out of the course. Augmented Reality has been used to overcome some of these difficulties, also with the use of some technological tools (3D glasses, computers, tablets) and innovative methodologies. In order to evaluate the impact of this approach on students' interaction and participation, an experimentation with an e-learning platform based on Augmented Reality was carried out evaluating some affective and interaction parameters, computed through a Fuzzy Cognitive Map.",

abstract="Teaching introductory computer science is gradually shifting from learning a computer programming language towards acquiring more generic computational thinking skills. At the same time, more emphasis is placed nowadays in natural and playful approaches that can potentially increase student motivation and engagement. One promising such approach is the combination of tangible elements with augmented reality technology, where the instructions can be given in the real world by manipulating physical elements, and the output is presented in a digitally enhanced space. Despite its potential, this approach has not yet been evaluated in formal educational settings. In this paper we present the results from a preliminary study in an elementary school that compared a tangible AR game with the same game in an unplugged version, to examine the effect of the interface on student motivation, effectiveness and teaching practice. The results indicate that a tangible AR approach can improve the engagement and collaboration of students in classroom activities and affects the role of the instructor compared to unplugged activities. The paper concludes with a number of open issues that need to be further studied.",

We evaluated the prototype on twenty-seven pilot students at the Lund University School of Aviation (LUSA), to explore the possibilities and technical advantages that AR can offer, in particular the procedure that is performed before takeoff. The prototype got positive results on perceived workload, and in remembering the flow pattern. The main contribution of this paper is to elucidate knowledge about the value of using AR for training pilot students.",

abstract="The spatial competence for learning three-dimensional objects in the geometry course makes Augmented Reality a perfect ally, due to its popularity among children allowing them to experience more realistic learning. Also, the use of augmented reality allows to improve the interactive and spatial skills with three-dimensional objects. A mobile interactive augmented reality system with 3D models was developed for the teaching of geometry, allowing the teacher to obtain real-time results of the student's spatial and mathematical competence in a real-world environment. In the mobile system, a playful environment capable of visualizing geometric figures (Cube, Rectangular Prism, Triangular Prism, Pyramid, Cone, Cylinder and Sphere), and formulas to calculate its volume are proposed. After learning the formulas, the student must continue with the game and obtain the highest score without visualizing the formulas in such a way that in a competitive environment they can experience more realistic and beneficial learning to improve their spatial competence. The students evaluated are in the primary level (sixth grade) of two classrooms in the city of Arequipa, Peru, enrolled in a one-week course (4 h a week) entitled ``Mathematical Logic'', and divided into a experimental group (they used Voluminis) and a control group (traditional methodology). A performance test (post-test) and a satisfaction questionnaire were used. In addition, a pre-test to both groups to determine the same level of knowledge about spatial geometry. The results revealed a positive impact on performance, greater academic motivation of students and above all increased competition among students in the Voluminis game. Thanks to the results in real time the professor observed the learning difficulties of the students and obtained the immediate qualifications of the space competition. Voluminis can be part of the qualified evaluation of the course, because it provides the evolution of each student in the area of geometry. It also helps to strengthen space skills thanks to the competition activities that occur in the game.",

abstract="This paper examines the perceptions of Greek Primary School teachers about the educational use of mobile augmented reality (MAR). The research of this study includes the design and development of an educational application which involves augmented reality and mobile learning. Additional information and digital features, following the school curriculum, were superimposed to the user's real world through the utilization of mobile devices. Primary school teachers were familiarized with the application and formed their opinions regarding mobile augmented reality in the teaching process after using it. Then, they filled out a questionnaire based on the technology acceptance model (TAM). The analysis of the data that were collected showed significant correlations between the variables. In particular, it was found that teachers' intention to use the mobile AR application that was designed is related both to perceived usefulness and to perceived ease of use. Teachers enjoyed the mobile augmented reality experience and considered the app as a useful and easy to use tool, which has a lot to offer to their teaching.",

abstract="The project ``Tales on Rails'' describes the research and development of an augmented reality game that can be played on trains with smartphones. The project addresses tourism changes in the digital age; the ubiquitous use of smartphones alters a tourist's travel experience, from accessing timetables to conveying cultural and historic information or transforming traditional souvenirs. ``Tales on Rails'' tested a smartphone application allowing tourists to play a game about a crime story on the route between the cities of Lucerne and Interlaken, which is operated by the Swiss railways company zb Zentralbahn AG. The game directly references the environment outside the train on this route as well as cultural themes about the region. The game's progress is linked to the position of the train, successively unlocking its content on the route. The game is tailored for use by 20 to 30-year-old leisure travellers, and optimized for a group experience in which two to four players collaborate on solving the game; thus, group dynamics during the gaming experience could be investigated. The game features a technologically ambitious program with augmented reality game elements, while minimizing negative impacts on playability by environmental influences such as seasonal and weather conditions. The technical complexity of the concept could be expanded in future iterations. The project ``Tales on Rails'' was released in July 2019 as fully functional game application in the Google Play Store and the Apple Store.",

abstract="Human behavior is considered to be the weakest link in the field of cybersecurity. Despite the development of a wide range of Augmented Reality (AR) applications in various domains, no AR application is available to educate users and increase their awareness of cybersecurity issues. Thus, we developed a game based on AR techniques as an Android app called CybAR. Since there have been few acceptance studies in the field of AR, it was particularly important to identify the factors that affect user acceptance of AR technology. This paper aims to identify whether gamification features influence users' acceptance of the CybAR app and increase their cybersecurity awareness. The predictors of CybAR app usage were derived from the extended unified theory of acceptance and usage of technology (UTAUT2) with the addition of the gamification factor. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of a study addressing the impact of gamification features on acceptance of the CybAR game. The theoretical model was tested in a quantitative study using structural equation modelling, conducted in Australia, with 95 Macquarie University students. The findings indicate that there is a significant relationship between gamification factors and behavioural intention to use the CybAR app and actual use of the CybAR app.",

abstract="Augmented Reality (AR) is an emerging technology that is gaining in popularity as it becomes more affordable. AR applications superimpose computerized objects on top of the users' physical world. Through the use of mobile devices or AR glasses, users can see their physical environment around them as well as the digital artifacts. AR has been touted as the next technology to replace our current smartphone and desktop experiences for everyday activities. For example, online shopping, examination of health information, interior decorating, and family communication are activities that have the potential to be enhanced by AR. Older adults, in particular, stand to benefit from this technology. This paper discusses the usability and user experience (UX) of AR applications among older adults. In addition, it explains the heuristics that have been suggested for AR applications and how they can be applied to older adult populations. Such heuristics allow providers of AR solutions to more quickly and reliably assess usability and UX, which in turn facilitates informed iterative design/development, resulting in more satisfying, efficient, and effective solutions.",

abstract="A nation's cultural heritage is of great importance both for indigenous people as well as for foreigners as it is a nation's contribution to humanity and global civilization. As the spark to discover that treasure has ignited and travelling around the world has become much easier, it is necessary to enhance the way that monuments are exhibited and communicated. Current technology offers the capability to alter the way that information is provided and represented. Augmented reality (AR) is the most characteristic example as it surpasses the limits that exist in other media offering a unique experience to the user. A great challenge for AR is to shed a new light on monuments, especially in cities like Athens, filled with historical monuments. In this paper we describe the methodology that was followed in order to create an AR application that will provide users with a virtual time leap experience in the past depicting the monument's history in its social context. Thus, the issues emerging during the development of an AR app is discussed, as well as solutions to common problems regarding its utilization in outdoors space. Aiming to shed light on its importance throughout the centuries, an interdisciplinary research has been conducted combining fields like architecture and psychology in order to inform and in parallel, arouse emotions to visitors and thus, intensify the experience. Supporting that, user experience has been enhanced following a UI/UX approach, which provides the appropriate tools between easy-to-use and following a narrative.",

Alzheimer's brain have impact on affecting brain, include loss of memory, difficulty in thinking, language and solving problems symptoms. Heart issues, depression, diabetes and high blood pressure pose a higher risk of causing Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's disease in the brain proteins build up to form structures known as plaques, which are the abnormal clumps in the brain, and tangles which are the bundles of fibbers in the brain. This leads to loss of brain tissue, nerve cells connections and lead to death of nerve cells. In their brain there is a shortage of chemicals. These chemical messengers around the brain help to transmit signals whose shortage causes the signals do not transmit effectively. The above symptoms were visualized as AR (Augmented Reality) model to assist doctors for medical analysis. Augmented Reality act as a extremity tool for findings, supporting and analyse the Alzheimer's Disease. Understanding the AR brain model enhance the analysis of the brain with the technical exploration of tracking, visualization technology layer by layer level, integrated feedback about different parts of the brain function which plays a major role in clinical evaluation to treat the Alzheimer's disease.

We document how these designs are in a tension between allowing game-based interactions, and the didactic communication about facts in the exhibition. We study the implemented solutions based on qualitative interviews with visitors, and with quantitative data from the backend game analytics of the installations. From triangulating these data sets we show how attempts to deliver purely fact-based information through didactic design elements fail to succeed in engaging the visitors, while stealth learning sparks enlightenment about the subject matter. Our results suggest that this is true both in cases in which users fully understand and play through the intended interactions, as well as when more negotiated interpretations of the digital installations are performed. From this our contribution are guiding principles for the balance, between experience and enlightenment in gamified exhibition designs.",

abstract="Substantial advances in technology have consistently been developed alongside new methods of interaction. With the recent advances in the areas of both augmented and virtual reality (AR, VR), there exists a strong need to explore what new interaction paradigms should be implemented to ensure the best possible user experience for those engaging with these technologies. With VR having far more definition in this space then AR, the focus of this research is on defining types of functionality best suited for a product that can assist its user in better navigating an AR-based experience. Research areas were selected based upon the information most relevant to AR-wearable products, including: use-cases, wearable technology, and virtual reality. Each of these subjects occupied a distinct phase of research (1--3). Insight gained from the present study could serve as a useful guide for the design of a concept peripheral product with the goal of improving the user experience of those unfamiliar with AR systems. Results showed that there is certainly a potential opportunity for an AR product in the right environment, that the general public is ready and willing to adopt wearable technology so long as it supplies enough functionality to justify its use, and that adopting affordances of technology that users are familiar with such as touch screens and haptic vibrations greatly improves the comfort and ease of use of AR products.",

This unique display medium presents new opportunities for application design, as applications can move beyond the desktop and integrate with the physical environment. In order to build effective applications for AR displays, we need to be able to iteratively design for different contexts or scenarios. We present MRCAT (Mixed Reality Content Authoring Toolkit), a tool for in situ prototyping of mixed reality environments. We discuss the initial design of MRCAT and iteration after a study ({\$}{\$}N = 14{\$}{\$}N=14) to evaluate users' abilities to craft AR applications with MRCAT and with a 2D prototyping tool. We contextualize our system in a case study of museum exhibit development, identifying how existing ideation and prototyping workflows could be bolstered with the approach offered by MRCAT. With our exploration of in situ prototyping, we enumerate key aspects both of AR application design and targeted domains that help guide design of more effective AR prototyping tools.",

The traditional editorial design has had to adapt to the new digital media composition, where multimedia audiovisual elements unthinkable a few years ago need to be integrated. The participation of the reader, as an external observer who only receives information through texts and images, now has new scenarios in which he can actively participate and decide what will come to his hands. In this study, a work methodology based on UxD User Experience Design is presented, in which will generate the editorial design of an educational book on environmental issues, which includes augmented reality for children from 6 to 8 years of age. The aim of this study is to know if an editorial product with augmented reality and developed from the user experience design can improve meaningful learning in a playful and active way. For its development, a composition model based on the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio will be used. Additionally, its graphic composition will be guided by the Massimo Vignelli canon and will be complemented by the reticular model of Beth Tondreau. The augmented reality markers position will also be based on the composition model previously mentioned, which will allow keeping the attention of the reader in the printed document and in the augmented reality animations. The user experience design will be applied with teachers, parents and students from 4 schools in Quito and Ambato. Once the production is completed, the impact on teaching-learning process will be evaluated with a control and a test group, and the methodology with which they will work in the classroom with the educational material developed will be defined. At the end of the study, copies of the book will be delivered to the participating schools of this research for its implementation.",

To this aim we restructured the classroom environment utilizing tangible interfaces to create a multimodal learning framework, where 6-year-old learners could play, collaborate and interact. Twenty (20) first grade children of a Primary School in Greece (experimental group) were engaged in digital activities learning about Greek mythology and ancient history, while eighteen (18) children of the same grade and school (control group) were taught the same context in a more traditional learning environment. Both qualitative and quantitative data was collected by means of: a) non-equivalent posttest only, b) the teacher/researcher's journal and, c) semi-structured interviews with the experimental group members. The results indicated that a higher vocabulary retention rate was observed when DS and AR were incorporated.",

abstract="Augmented and virtual reality in combination with robotics offers unique design opportunities centered around novel human machine collaboration. The coordination of these tools allows for unique modes of collaborative design, sensory stimulation and strategic deception. In this paper, we outline the components and calibration of a collaborative environment which coordinates industrial robotics, mobile augmented reality, and virtual reality. This technical setup allows for multiple modes of experimentation, encouraging reflection on the larger domain of human-robotic collaboration. As such, this work facilitates the definition of four discrete modes of robotic collaboration: Stop-Gap Collaboration, Manual-Assist Collaboration, Creative Collaboration, and Environmental Collaboration. Stop-Gap Collaboration uses humans to bridge technical gaps in automated systems. Manual-Assist Collaboration uses digital tools to augment the human execution of technical tasks. Creative Collaboration prioritizes creative expression, while Environmental Collaboration considers humans as agents in occupied and continuously evolving robotic environments. As robotics gains prominence in design and manufacturing, it becomes increasingly important to examine the role of human beings in partially automated workflows---prioritizing creativity and environmental adaptivity in design applications.",

To study the working hypothesis, we identified four areas of action: 1. Focused on training and interaction with architecture students, specifically urbanism students, for the design of urban public spaces. 2. Centred on the training of multimedia engineers who will design and implement gamified processes on information and communication technology (ICT). 3. Focused on students', professionals' and citizens' motivation and degree of satisfaction with the use of ICT. 4. Centred on studying and increasing citizen participation in this type of projects and proposals.

Despite the pervasiveness and attention given to m-learning, there is still a lot of unknowns about how to integrate mobile technology into learning practices. Therefore, this paper describes an exploratory survey study that examined U.S. college and university students' responses to collect data about current mobile technology use. Novel to this study, gaining a clearer picture of mobile technology from students, educators and researchers can better apply m-learning to target desired learning behaviors and outcomes. Results suggest students have access to many mobile devices, however, they tend to be very selective in what device they choose to use for their learning. The findings indicate that their use of mobile technology is highly dependent upon the characteristics of the learning activity they are engaging in, and the subject matter. Students also reported mobile devices having a positive impact on their learning for quick, just-in-time learning activities.",

Also, automated assessment and guidance mechanisms should be considered that meet the requirements of modern competency-oriented curricula and support teachers in the classroom. In this paper, we investigate the current adoption of digital assessment tools and simulations, how teachers and research experts assess students in competency-oriented learning settings and present an extended conceptual architecture for flexible automated assessment in immersive environments. First results indicate that basic e-assessment techniques are still not fully prevalent in secondary education, but most teachers have expressed interest in simulations with automated assessment features.",

Based on classroom discourse analysis, investigation of several studies of computer assisted learning -both for single and peer learning- and our understanding of the assistance dilemma of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), we argue that the students' need for (artificial) facilitator's help emphasizes on the manner of hint-providing, so we should take particular note of the challenges that arise from formalizing these definitions to apply to the style of problem solving and the students' different age groups. This is the first step towards a mobile ITS that utilizes eye-tracking and virtual reality glasses, in order to identify difficulties and offer on time feedback in textual or visual mode, which will be superimposed on a transparent lens in users' field of view. We will conclude with a discussion of implications and future directions.",

abstract="HCI, as the cooperation of humans and machines in socio-technical systems, is playing an increasingly important role in production technology and logistics applications. This cooperation will lead to a higher occurrence of interaction among these actors in production and logistics work. One of the central challenges in this context is the development of interfaces between humans and machines. In this paper, the evaluation of HCI systems is examined based on three use cases. The participation of users in the evaluation of HCI system development is investigated by means of the design of human work in Cyber-physical production systems, the use of Augmented Reality as a promising new technology in production scenarios, as well as on the example of a serious game-based decision support in urban logistics. The implementation of user-based evaluation studies in the use cases shows that such studies can increase user acceptance of HCI systems in the context of production and logistics. Especially in connection with new technologies, this can be achieved by the early development of prototypes and the participation of the user over the entire development process.",

Due to the global financial crisis the funds available to sustain the operations of museums and libraries become difficult not only to obtain them but also to utilized them effectively and efficiently. The operational costs of museums increase over the time due to exhibit maintenance and acquisition costs. This cost is inversely proportional to the revenues that can be generated. Virtual reality, avatar technologies, virtual worlds, holograms, gaming and gamification can offer creative interactivity and unique experiences with low or no cost to the global visitor and introduce new revenue streams. This paper practically integrates the realization of digital cultural strategies and operations within the context of digital humanities economics that can turn museums and libraries from cost centres to profit centres for the benefit of the humanity and the society.",

abstract="Given the sometimes disparate findings and the increasing application of AR in both training and operations, as well as increased affordability and availability, it is important for researchers, user interface and user experience (UI/UX) designers, and AR technology developers to understand the factors that impact the utility of AR. To increase the potential for realizing the full benefit of AR, adequately detailing the interrelated factors that drive outcomes of different AR usage schemes is imperative. A systematic approach to understanding influential factors, parameters, and the nature of the influence on performance provides the foundation for developing AR usage protocols and design principles, which currently are few. Toward this end, this work presents a theoretical model of factors impacting performance with AR systems. The framework of factors, including task, human, and environmental factors, conceptualizes the concept of ``AR Receptivity'', which aims to characterize the degree to which the application of AR usage is receptive to the technology design and capabilities. The discussion begins with a brief overview of research efforts laying the foundation for the model's development and moves to a review of receptivity as a concept of technology suitability. This work provides details on the model and factor components, concluding with implications for application of AR in both the training and operational settings.",

Four types of creative process are described in which the role of the digital is differentiated as tool, medium, mediator and partner. In many cases, the digital technology performs more than one role: practitioners are using ready-made tools for making interactive works and at the same time writing algorithms to create digital partners with whom they perform. In this kind of creative practice, the technology is often the material of the creative works as well as the means by which they are made. It can enable a wide range of aesthetic qualities as well as facilitate different kinds of experience for both creators and audiences. This is a journey that many artists are taking in the 21st century contemporary digital arts world. The discussion is illustrated by the works of creative practitioners for whom digital technology is integral to the way they work.",

abstract="The contribution suggests reflecting upon participatory mapping of cultural values processes contained in everyday landscapes, particularly fragile environments such as peripheral urban areas. The theme is addressed starting from the reexamination of Politecnico di Milano research experience which focused on the involvement of younger generations in landscape education and enhancement of the widespread cultural heritage processes. From this experimental project, we developed tools and methodologies to support institutions in standardising local heritage education. Within this framework, the participatory mapping tradition becomes an important reference for its subjective and interdisciplinary aspect and ability to represent the community's spatial knowledge, because it offers cues for technological integration in processes for inexperienced users. Mapping used here is a reading, interpreting, communicating and sharing process which involves multiple players and educational frameworks. Drafting such maps combines traditional methodologies and innovative technologies and allows the development of different activities and products including learning tours, visual storytelling, sketches, mind maps, interactive digital maps, Geographic Information Systems, virtual reality environments, interactive digital tourist tours and gamification apps. The availability of these tools allows young citizens to become active players in the knowledge and communication processes, to strengthen their sense of belonging to places, to develop active citizenship, to foster intergenerational and intercultural dialogues, and to protect the cultural landscape as a common good.",

abstract="Educational visits to museums are beneficial for pupils in terms of differentiated teaching and cognitive objectives accomplishment. Pupils' direct contact with historical and cultural evidence activates visual perception and observation skills. Moreover, when activities during such visits are gamified, learning process becomes more attractive. Therefore, pupils' interest is increased. Equally important is the active involvement of children in educational activities' preparation. Tutorials production for peers promotes motivation and participation willingness. Active involvement opposes the discouraging impression of young pupils, who often think themselves as passive receivers of obscure and uninspiring information during educational museums visits. In recent years, interactive educational activities in museums are developed, based on the utilization of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), such as playful applications for pupils' mobile devices. The development of an interactive Augmented Reality (AR) playful activity in Hellenic Maritime Museum (HMM) is presented in this article. A small scale-study was conducted to measure the cognitive and attitude benefits for pupils after the completion of the study. The results are briefly presented in the article.",

This paper particularly focuses on the role of decision-making style in avoidance of risky cybersecurity behaviour based on factors derived from Technology Threat Avoidance Theory (TTAT). A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 95 students at Macquarie University to assess the effect of individual differences, namely, decision-making style, as a moderator variable between motivation behaviour and cybersecurity avoidance behaviour factors. The findings indicated that the moderating effect of decision-making style had a significant effect on avoidance behaviour. In particular, rational decision-making was a strongly significant moderator of avoidance behaviour and cybersecurity avoidance behaviour, while dependent and avoidant styles were less significant moderators of avoidance behaviour and cybersecurity avoidance behaviour.",

Two-person teams (dyads) played the role of commander's staff tasked with planning the most efficient and safest mission route for a squad of soldiers to extract a repository of intelligence documents from the ruins of a building located in enemy territory. Quantitative and qualitative measures of performance were collected. We focused on two performance measures: total mission planning time and mission execution time (the planned route run in a simulated execution mode). Surprisingly, there was a significant decrease in planning time when using the Surface Touch Table. The dyads needed on average 86{\%} more time to plan the mission using the HoloLens. Additionally, this increase in mission planning time associated with the HoloLens did not produce a more optimal mission solution. In a search for understanding the unexpected results, a content analysis of a preferred visualization questionnaire is described. Analysis results suggested: a more realistic scene invited unnecessary exploration instead of focused time on task; becoming familiar with the HoloLens spilled over into task time; collaborative and communication difficulties stemmed from the HoloLens being designed as a single-user device.",

abstract="Technologies of Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) are increasingly applied in urban construction and smart cities. As one of the high fidelity revivification methods, the purpose of these applications is to provide a better immerse experience over the combination of realistic and virtual interactions. Numerous methods and models are adopted to simulate real life scenarios. Regularly, first-person perspective (1PP) is a spontaneous way to revive reality virtually, and this is also what most manufacturers do. In a different way, we tend to verify the feasibility of a new perspective for VR, AR or MR: a third-person perspective (3PP) with multiple Point of View (PoV) from different fixed cameras. We implemented an immersive AR environment for users to control or view themselves in a third person perspective. They are able to switch among different perspectives in different angles, including a first-person view. We developed a simple game based on this environment and conducted user study with this implementation. The result shows that people will generally be intrigued and willing to pay for a new MR experience (like 3PP) if the process is effortless and pleasurable. The most welcomed thing is the ability to switch perspectives during a VR or AR experience. This environment can be extended to real world services such as interviewing, dating and picnic, etc. or future smart cities services that use VR and AR, such as VR traffic management, VR communities empathetic planning and AR navigation, etc.",

The paper addresses some problems of machine vision application for production quality control, which helps solving the challenges for AR guides and improving the efficiency of their implementation in practice. In particular, augmented reality allows users to undergo interactive training and receive active assistance during the execution of technological operations without the need to refer to a set of documentation in paper or electronic form. Within the developed framework there is presented a new solution architecture that combines the capabilities of neural networks, Ontologies and Big Data processing facilities. The proposed approach is recommended to improve the quality of recognizing production operations and manufactured products using machine vision technologies and neural networks in industrial applications.",

abstract="A story app is a children's digital book which takes advantage of the multimedia and multimodality resources of mobile interaction devices. However, the poorly design of the interactive areas (hotspots) in story apps can compromise the reading activity and children's literacy acquisition. This is even more serious in mediated reading between children and parents, since the latter may not know how to use the hotspots or even feel that their presence is superfluous due to the digital resources. Outgoing from this scenario, we have carried out a user study with six parent-child dyads to investigate the effects of hotspots on the readers' experience during mediated reading of three-story apps to identify design problems and opportunities. The study measured five aspects of the interaction with hotspots, namely: 1) understanding, locating and recognizing hotspots; 2) balanced versus unbalanced number of interactions; 3) reading flow versus reading difficulties during the interaction; 4) engagement versus distraction in reading caused by the interactions; 5) distance versus closeness in mediation. The analyses indicate that hotspots are usually not designed for mediated reading, which may lead to parents' disengagement. Poorly located or misrepresented hotspots caused navigation errors negatively impacting reading. Contrary to findings reported by previous studies, we observed that the interactive game areas can provide a common point for intergenerational convergence stimulating mediated reading.",

abstract="Short-term qualification for temporary workers is a constant challenge for manufacturing companies. Cycle times of machines often have to be reduced for training processes, which demands time and financial resources. This increases the need for near-the-job trainings without manipulating cycle times of the machine. Digital visualization tools using Mixed Reality (MR) promise opportunities for application-oriented practical training. However, especially for industrial applications, where procedural knowledge has to be transferred, it is not clear which MR technology should be used for which purpose. In order to answer this question, this paper examines the underlying MR-features of the technology. In an experimental setting, the same virtual training for the assembly of a pneumatic cylinder is examined with an augmented reality/augmented virtuality (AR/AV) based application in comparison to a virtual reality (VR) based application. Based on the carried out study, there are significant differences in the evaluation of the system usability, but no differences in the evaluation of the ergonomics and the perceived task load during the task. Out of 16 test persons, 14 would choose the VR system in the final analysis. The results are discussed in the paper and recommendations for the design of MR based systems in an industrial context are given.",

However, implementing a disruptive tool such as AR into the workforce requires considerations for acceptability and compliance amongst employees. AugmenTech is a proposed AR guidance application which was designed and tested with a strong focus on usability. Due to issues with the HoloLens native input modalities in the application area, a tactile input module has been designed and integrated with the system. A mock-up bearing replacement maintenance procedure, based on a real-world use case provided by a local manufacturer, has been designed as a platform for evaluation. Using this task and AugmenTech a between-subjects experiment was conducted, comparing the system with a traditional paper documentation approach. Overall workload, quantified using the NASA-TLX, was similar when using AR. Likewise, the use of AR also had minimal effect on time needed to complete the task. The usability of AugmenTech has been quantified, scoring highly, (M = 79.5, SD = 16.13), using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire.",

Industry 4.0 is a new paradigm of production and one that leads to a faster and more precise decision-making, entirely new approach to production, work organization manner of work task performance, which may have a significant influence on the health and safety of workers. Objectives: To provide an overview of potential effects (positive and negative) of Industry 4.0 on occupational health and safety and to list some of the recommendations regarding the integration of OHS into manufacturing in the Industry 4.0 context. Methods: A critical review of the literature currently available on this topic. Results: There are many risks as well as opportunities for occupational health and safety that derive from Industry 4.0. A considerable challenge, especially in the transitional period, is posed by insufficiency of initiatives with respect to occupational health and safety including standards and regulations, which may render them incommensurate in the face of newer and newer threats as Industry 4.0 technologies emerge. Furthermore, it may lead to forfeiting the proactive approach towards occupational health and safety that has been established in the most industrialized countries. Further research is required to enhance integration of occupational health and safety into manufacturing in the context of Industry 4.0. To achieve this, an interdisciplinary approach needs to be adopted drawing on the expertise of a team comprising engineers, IT experts, psychologists, ergonomists, social and occupational scientists, medical practitioners, and designers. The overview was carried by the research group IDEAT.",

This paper introduces an omnichannel value chain model underpinned by Porter's value chain and presents ten channel integration activities for value creation by carrying out a comprehensive synthesis of current research on omnichannel retailing. We also identify the technology related challenges faced by retailers in the execution of these channel integrating activities drawing upon a case study with an Irish retailer. Enabling digital technologies are then mapped to these activities that provide a guideline for retailers to select appropriate technologies for the value creation activities.",

abstract="The UNESCO considers as part of the cultural heritage of a place, the intangible cultural heritage (ICH) which is a practice, an expression or representation and knowledge or skill, as well as instruments, objects and cultural places. The cultural heritage includes the traditions or living expressions inherited from the ancestors and passed on to the descendants, not only the monuments or collections of objects. Such features are oral traditions, social practices, arts, festive events and generally, knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe or the knowledge and skills to produce traditional crafts. Terpsichore project targets at integrating the latest innovative results of photogrammetry, semantic technologies, computer vision and time evolved modelling, along with traditional choreography and narrative. The study, design, research, education, analysis, implementation and validation of an innovative framework for accessible digitization, modelling, archiving, online preservation and presentation of ICH content related folk dances is reflected in the project. The Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences of the Aristotle University was involved in the project in the performance of six traditional Greek dances and the three-dimensional capturing. Specifically, in the present work with the process of 3D recording of the movement of the Greek traditional dance ``Syrtos in three'', the method for identifying the dancers' gender will be proposed. The results showed that using 3D motion capturing we may recognize the sex of the dancer through the trajectories of toes markers and the kinematic data of joints angles. Regarding kinematic data founded differences at the means of angles of the hip, the knee and the ankle joints. Male dancers showed narrower angles in all mentioned joints of all six steps than the angles of female dancers during the implementation of the Greek traditional dance ``Syrtos in three steps''.",

It necessitates novel interactions between operators and machines, consequently leading to the transformation of a traditional operator to Operator 4.0 or Smart Operator. Improvement in operators and engineers' cognitive skills is imminent to adapt to Industry 4.0 working environment. Wearable technology, sensors, or virtual reality equipment enhances cognitive capabilities of the Operator 4.0. Thus cognitive skills of the smart operators are required more rather than the physical strength.

In this paper, we address a shortcoming in the extant literature, which presents an abundance of roadmaps for digitalization but very few addressing this in combination with lean. As such, we present a learning roadmap for digital lean manufacturing, with a core focus on cybersecurity. The roadmap has been developed and tested by combining theory with practical insights at the Norwegian Catapult Lean4zero Lab, Norway's first and only full-scale digital lean simulator.",

The participants were 15 high school students majoring in computer science. The program included three parts studied at the Technion. In the robotics course, the students constructed and programmed mobile robotic arms to pick and place objects of unknown weight and communicate via the IoT platform ThingWorx. In the second course, the school students programmed a TurtleBot Waffle robot equipped by LIDAR sensor to navigate in an environment by means of simultaneous localization and mapping. In the mini project the students programmed two mobile robotic arms and the Waffle to implement a warehouse scenario, in which the robots jointly carried out loading, transportation and warehousing of a cargo. Assessment results indicated that the students acquired initial understanding of the studied concepts.

abstract="Ensuring proper education for employees represents a key factor in most of the industrial sectors. Several researches have been conducted in order to test the efficiency of new educational methods for improving their flexibility and effectiveness. At the same time, the introduction of emergent technologies, such as Virtual Reality (VR), is offering new solutions for industries for both reducing cost of training programmes and for better tailoring those on the needs of the users. Based on a first cross-industry reflection, the paper analyses how the combination of adaptive learning methods with VR could bring substantial benefits to companies (railway and process industry) in replacing the actual training programmes based on traditional learning approaches. Firstly, the paper offers a short overview on the features of adaptive learning and VR. Secondly, a consideration on the main requirements on railway sector and process industry is conducted in order to link them with constrains appeared during the current training programmes. Finally, possible solutions based on the previous findings are highlighted in order to sketch a possible working framework for creating a Virtual Reality Adaptive Learning Tool. Our research, thereby, shows how long-term strategic educational policies can impact the performance of the industries.",

However, these ``cogs'' need not be capable of full general artificial intelligence nor able to function in a stand-alone manner. Instead, cogs and humans will work together in collaboration each compensating for the weaknesses of the other and together achieve synthetic expertise as an ensemble. This paper reviews the nature of expertise, the Expertise Level to describe the skills required of an expert, and knowledge stores required by an expert. By collaboration, cogs augment human cognitive ability in a human/cog ensemble. This paper introduces six Levels of Cognitive Augmentation to describe the balance of cognitive processing in the human/cog ensemble. Because these cogs will be available to the mass market via common devices and inexpensive applications, they will lead to the Democratization of Expertise and a new cognitive systems era promising to change how we live, work, and play. The future will belong to those best able to communicate, coordinate, and collaborate with cognitive systems.",

abstract="First person videos and games are the central paradigms of camera positioning when using Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). In these situations, the user's hands and arms play a fundamental role in self-presence feeling and interface. While their visual image is trivial in Augmented Reality devices or when using depth cameras attached to the HMDs, their rendering is not trivial to be solved with regular HMD, such as those based on smartphone devices. This work proposes the usage of semantic image segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks for detaching user's hands and arms from a raw image, captured by regular cameras, positioned as a First Person visual schema. We first create a training dataset composed by 4041 images and a validation dataset composed of 322 images, both of them receive labels for an arm and no-arm pixels, focused on the egocentric view. Then, based on two important architectures related to semantic segmentation - PSPNet and Deeplab - we propose a specific calibration for the particular scenario composed of hands and arms, captured from an HMD perspective. Our results show that PSPNet has better detail segmentation while Deeplab achieves best inference time performance. Training with our egocentric dataset generates better arm segmentation than using images in different and more general perspectives.",

abstract="Interacting in 3D has considerable and growing importance today in several areas and most computer systems are equipped with both a mouse or touchscreen and one or more cameras that can be readily used for gesture-based interaction. Literature comparing mouse and free-hand gesture interaction, however, is still somewhat sparse in regards to user satisfaction, learnability and memorability, which can be particularly important attributes for applications in education or entertainment. In this paper, we compare the use of mouse-based interaction with free-hand bimanual gestures to translate, scale and rotate a virtual 3D object. We isolate object manipulation from its selection and focus particularly on those three attributes to test whether the related variables show significant differences when comparing both modalities. To this end, we integrate a gesture recognition system, Microsoft's Kinect and an educational virtual atlas of anatomy, then design and perform an experiment with 19 volunteers, combining data from self-reported metrics and event logs. Our results show that, in this context, the difference is indeed significant and favors the use of gestures for most experimental tasks and evaluated attributes.",

abstract="Synthesizing three-dimensional objects from single or multiple two-dimensional views has been a challenging task. To combat this, several techniques involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have been proposed. Since its advent in 2014, there has been a tremendous amount of research done in the area of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Among the various applications of GANs, image synthesis has shown great potential due to the power of two deep neural networks---generator and discriminator, trained in a competitive way, which are able to produce reasonably realistic images. Formulation of 3D-GANs---which are able to generate three-dimensional objects from multiple two-dimensional views with impressive accuracy---has emerged as a promising solution to the aforementioned issue. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of deep learning methods used in generating three-dimensional objects, reviews the different models and frameworks for three-dimensional object generation, and discusses some evaluation metrics and future research direction in using GANs as an alternative for simultaneous localization and environment mapping as well as leveraging the power of GANs to revolutionize the field of education and medicine.",

abstract="The rising population of older adult has contributed to the increasing number of elderly suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Abundant new exciting applications have been developed to assist people with Alzheimer's to support a better quality of life. The design of software product for older people should be carefully carried out as it could reduce the gap between computer technology and older people. Efficient and effective user design needs to be considered when developing an application for the elderly with memory and cognitive impairments. This paper presents a report on the usability evaluation of a personalized digital memory book application (my-MOBAL) for people with Alzheimer's disease. It is developed for a 74 years old woman who is diagnosed with mild AD. The application was evaluated on its usability and functionality using seven (7) experts in Gerontology and HCI with more than ten (10) years experience in their fields. The results show that the application is user friendly, simple and easy to navigate. It was also suggested that the application would be a suitable tool to assist people with AD to use in their non-pharmacological therapy session.",

abstract="Prototyping is one of the most critical and costly steps in the product development process. However, the existing literature lacks in prototyping strategies that are comprehensive and widely accepted. Current prototyping strategies mostly focus on the hands-on activity of building the prototype by relying on the designer's experience. Another limitation is that prototyping strategies often do not address human factors for prototyping human-centered products. This paper introduces a House of Prototyping Guidelines (HOPG) framework, which integrates the existing prototyping guidelines and human factor engineering principles for better prototyping outcomes. The methodology contains four steps. The first step pertains to the state-of-the-art prototyping literature review. The second step consists of filtering the prototyping findings and summarizing the key prototyping findings from Step 1. The third step presents the HOPG conceptual map, which is loosely based on the House of Quality (HOQ) approach. HOPG contains the Prototyping Categories and Prototyping Dimensions, which are similar to Customer Requirement and Engineering Requirement of HOQ, respectively. In the HOPG framework, designers go through the Prototyping Categories to understand the prototyping requirements and then identifies the Prototyping Dimensions to create the prototypes that fit human-centered design needs.",

Faculty and students from the University of Turku created a Living Lab ``Alive in Smart Countryside'' to the rural municipalities Juuka and Kitee, located in North Karelia, Finland. Living Lab promoted disruptive innovation in order to design solutions toward smart countryside. In addition to analyzing and examining the design endeavor, we discuss the project as an informal learning initiative.

abstract="Contemporary computer systems fully integrate people's daily lives in the most diversified contexts. The adequate construction of those systems demands well-defined patterns for including a whole community of users encompassing people with disabilities. Current interaction scenarios with pervasive computing technologies present design challenges for the applicability of standards and guidelines such as those of the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), suited for Web systems. Such scenarios require further studies to deal with the endeavor of supporting designers to project pervasive interactive systems that consider all people, regardless of their condition and ability, allowing different types of interactions to arise. In this article, we conduct an exploratory study to investigate the potential and limitations of current accessibility guidelines for pervasive systems. We explore the last decade of literature studies presenting solutions and challenges for accessibility found for pervasive and ubiquitous computing contexts. The results of this research indicate that it is desirable to define accessibility models for pervasive systems if we consider an accessibility layer that will indicate principles and solutions that should be generic enough to support different categories of impairments and contexts.",

It is shown that against the background of all-Russian changes in the institutional environment, one of the most important issues is the formation of a stable, long-term partnership between universities and industry. New innovative challenges require the strengthening of interaction between scientific, educational, and industrial spheres. In this regard, it is necessary to make a significant emphasis on the variability of higher education, which contributes to its adaptation to the new conditions of academic and economic autonomy of educational institutions. Research and innovation activities should be focused on obtaining new knowledge in the main strategic directions, the purpose of which is to attract young people from the sphere of science and education, to train highly qualified specialists, and to develop a socially oriented and competitive system of higher professional education. An important factor is the creation of new structural subdivisions aimed at organizing interaction between higher education institutions, research institutes, and enterprises in priority areas of research and education. It is shown that the integration of universities is the result of a targeted policy of increasing the competitiveness of higher education and states that use this potential for the development of their economy and social sphere. Stimulation of mutually beneficial partnership, creation of new graduate departments at production; research and innovation activities should contribute to the commercialization of scientific results and provide the Russian economy with qualified specialists with the necessary set of competencies for the generation and practical use of knowledge and skills in the field of information and energy-saving technologies, engineering, automation, new materials, etc.",

The four HCD tools intervene on idea generation, data collection planning, and both low and high-fidelity prototyping of the solutions. The aim is to assist designers, developers, and engineers in producing better H{\&}S integrated solutions by offering tools that meet HCD principles. The primary usage of the HCD tools with 27 graduate students assisted these multidisciplinary teams in creating five prototypes that were positively evaluated by end-users. Technical evaluation checks for the integrity of the prototypes after testing and results show comparative data on battery consumption and list potential privacy and security vulnerabilities. Improvements include adapting ideation tool to incorporate marketing-oriented strategies, authentication and data encryption for the toolkit, and assessing the tools with professional teams of the industry.",

The aim of Terpsichore project is to, analyze, design, research, train, implement and validate an innovative framework for affordable digitization, modelling, archiving, e-preservation and presentation of ICH content related to folk dances, in a wide range of users. The Aristotle University of Thessaloniki was involved in the performance of Greek traditional dances and the three-dimensional capturing and editing. The three-dimensional recordings were held at the Laboratory of ``Motor Behaviour and Adapted Physical Activity''. For data capturing we used the Vicon 3D recording system. Two Greek traditional dances from different regions of Greece were performed and captured. The results of the three-dimensional capturing of movement showed that the assessment of left toe trajectories through markers gives us the ability to identify the differences between two types of the Greek traditional dance ``Syrtos'', ``Syrtos Makedonikos'' and ``Syrtos Kalamatianos''. The findings of this work add a new approach to improve Greek traditional dances identification through 3D motion kinematic data analysis. They represent optical and mathematical representation of the rhythm of Greek traditional dances which could be used for the purposes of Terpsichore project.",

abstract="In today's society characterized by information explosion, the smart phone has become an indispensable convenience in modern people's lives, facilitating information inquiry, shopping, basic needs, as well as entertainment; meanwhile, it has changed people's living habits. Over the past ten or more years, there have been many game-related studies which mainly focused on online games for personal computers (PC). However, with the popularity of smart phones, mobile games have entered the new mainstream of the market. Pok{\'e}mon GO is an online game that combines a mobile device with augmented reality (AR). Through their smartphone screens, players can search for cartoon and animation characters in the real world. Ranging from small children, teenagers, and middle-aged people to old people over 70 years of age, all players try to capture virtual creatures, called Pok{\'e}mon. It is difficult for ordinary mobile online games to attract players of different age groups, i.e., young, middle-aged, and old players at the same time, while Pok{\'e}mon GO enables a wide variety of players to participate in the game simultaneously. Therefore, this study first analyzed the game design of Pok{\'e}mon GO and then explored the interactive factors involving the context where parents and children play together. The semi-structured interview was employed, with three participants interviewed. Through the interview, it was found that the game design of Pok{\'e}mon GO includes the following features: 1) a user-friendly interface, 2) going outdoors, 3) association with places of interest, 4) combining games with exercise, 5) cooperative gaming with the community, and 6) highlighting festivals to attract players. As for its impact on parent-child interaction, Pok{\'e}mon Go boasts the characteristics below: a) a common topic for the family, b) family members doing their cooperative gaming, c) training children to classify things and use logic, and d) fostering children's independence. Due to the foregoing factors, parent-child interaction can improve a lot. The results of this study can be referred to by game designers.",

abstract="Explainability is a hot topic nowadays for artificial intelligent (AI) systems. The role of machine learning (ML) models on influencing human decisions shed light on the back-box of computing systems. AI based system are more than just ML models. ML models are one element for the AI explainability' design and needs to be combined with other elements so it can have significant meaning for people using AI systems. There are different goals and motivations for AI explainability. Regardless the goal for AI explainability, there are more to AI explanation than just ML models or algorithms. The explainability of an AI systems behavior needs to consider different dimensions: 1) who is the receiver of that explanation, 2) why that explanation is needed, and 3) in which context and other situated information the explanation is presented. Considering those three dimensions, the explanation can be effective by fitting the user needs and expectation in the right moment and format. The design of an AI explanation user experience is central for the pressing need from people and the society to understand how an AI system may impact on human decisions. In this paper, we present a literature review on AI explainability research and practices. We first looked at the computer science (CS) community research to identify the main research themes about AI explainability, or ``explainable AI''. Then, we focus on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research trying to answer three questions about the selected publications: to whom the AI explainability is for (who), which is the purpose of the AI explanation (why), and in which context the AI explanation is presented (what + when).",

abstract="This paper discusses the motivation and potential methodologies for the use of mixed reality and multimodal interaction technologies to engage communities and members of the public with participation in the active creation and use of urban data. This research has been conducted within the context of a wider research program investigating the use of data dashboard technologies and open data to more effectively communicate information to urban authorities and citizens and enable more evidence-based decision making. These technologies have drawn criticism for promoting objectifying, data-driven approaches to urban governance that have proven insensitive to the specificity of place and the contexts of citizens' daily lives. Within the digital and spatial humanities, there has been growing interest in `deep mapping' as a means for recovering the sense of place and the nuances of everyday life through the incorporation of spatial narratives and multimedia in their mapping practices. This paper considers the ways in which mixed realities can contribute to these efforts, and in particular the unique affordances of virtual reality for evoking an embodied sense of presence that contributes to the communication of a sense of place via rich multisensory experiences. The paper concludes with the discussion of a pilot study conducted with members of the public. This demonstrates the ways in which virtual environments can be created in ways that maintain contextual and affective links to the places they represent as a result of involvement in `hands-on' activity of mapping through urban sensing and the capture of place-based media.",

abstract="Computation offloading has become a promising method to overcome intrinsic defects of portable smart devices, such as low operating speed and low battery capacity. However, it is a challenge to design an optimized strategy as the edge server is resource-constrained and the workflow application has timing constraints. In this paper, we investigated the hybrid workflow application computation offloading issue, which further increases the difficulty. According to the analysis of theory and consideration of time consumption and energy consumption, we establish a multi-objective optimization model to solve the issue. Furthermore, we propose a method based on particle swarm optimization algorithm for multi-objective computation offloading to get the optimal strategy for tasks offloading, which is suitable for all the hybrid workflow applications. Finally, extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.",

These vast multimodal corpora include visual and other sensor data and are enriched by content analysis, to generate as extensive a record of an individual's life experience. However, interfacing with such datasets remains an active area of research, and despite the advent of new technology and a plethora of competing mediums for processing digital information, there has been little focus on newly emerging platforms such as virtual reality. In this work, we suggest that the increase in immersion and spatial dimensions provided by virtual reality could provide significant benefits to users when compared to more conventional access methodologies. Hence, we motivate virtual reality as a viable method of exploring multimedia archives (specifically lifelogs) by performing a baseline comparative analysis using a novel application prototype built for the HTC Vive and a conventional prototype built for a standard personal computer.",

Until now, current research has scarcely focused on upcoming changes in technology-specific competencies due to digitalization and automation in logistics. The aim of this paper is to identify the competency requirements by means of semi-structured interviews with technology providers. The analysis indicates that demands for competencies change based on the use of hardware and software products. The paper identifies future relevant competencies and requirements for logistics employees so that Industry 4.0 technologies can be exploited.

abstract="Serious games are games with a purpose beyond entertainment and are widely acknowledged as fruitful tools for learning and developing skills across multiple domains, including educational enhancement. In the last few years, the world of serious games has widely increased. The use of these types of games can aid in classrooms to not only help the students learn concepts but also to improve their motivation to do so. However, designing games necessitates very specialized personnel and the process can often be costly and slow. The adaptions of the design to the implantation phase are also difficult and the process needs more focus. The challenge of this study was to create a game within the confines of cultural heritage and preservation that was an adventure game as well, available on any platform with a friendly user interface and free to download on the web. To achieve this great goal, it was necessary to overcome the limits and problems due to the virtual environment starting from 3D acquisition and finishing with image stability. In this paper, we show the flowchart and methodology for the optimization of a cultural heritage virtual environment for gaming applications.",

pages="619--630",
abstract="A Computerized Operator Support System (COSS) has been envisioned and prototyped for nuclear power plant (NPP) operations. The COSS supports operator decision making during abnormal events by making use of an online fault-diagnostic system known as PRO-AID. PRO-AID uses existing sensors and confluence equations to detect system faults before plant threshold alarms would alert operators. In a full-scope, full-scale nuclear power plant simulator we demonstrated that early diagnosis in conjunction with computer-based-procedures can assist operators in mitigating faults in circumstances that would normally lead to shutting down the plant. Here we conceive of a computerized plant management system (CPMS) that would complement COSS. COSS is intended to aid in the short-time scale operations of a plant. The CPMS is aimed at supporting longer time-scale activities involving maintenance, calibration, and early warning fault detection. Digitization allows staff to manage and monitor assets remotely without being physically present locally at the equipment under surveillance. This allows for specialization by equipment and systems rather than location. Cyber-physical systems and the industrial internet of things have no shortage of possibilities and promises, but often the benefits come with conflicting considerations: availability may tradeoff with increased cyber risk, increased redundancy may come at the cost of increased complexity, outsourcing engineering requires more communication across organizations and the associated administrative burden. In too many instances, humans tend to fill the gaps between what automation cannot reliably or cost-effectively accomplish. Human-centered design using human factors considers the role of the human as part of a human-machine-system. Our COSS concept examined how a control system, a diagnostic system, expert guidance system, and computer-based procedure system could work in concert to aid operator actions. Here we examine the potential for human factors and human-centered design for whole plant management using a CPMS. A CPMS could serve several valuable functions from providing computerized procedures for field operations to using prognostics for early failure detection, or managing information flows from sensors to business networks, system engineers, cyber-security personnel, and third-party vendors.",

abstract="Situational awareness is a crucial aspect for the survivability of combat vehicles and soldiers in the battlefield, as well as for the prevention of fratricide and collateral damage. Optical, radio and acoustic sensors for monitoring the battlefield can significantly increase situational awareness by providing further information to the crew. However, in time-critical situations, a crew can encounter problems when attempting to make meaningful use of this information, as cognitive resources are otherwise occupied during other operations, e.g. controlling a vehicle. Research from various fields clearly indicates that the correct use of Augmented Reality (AR) enables the crew to pay significantly greater attention to the current tasks, while maintaining an overview of the tactical situation. Adaptation strategies for presenting AR symbols as well as a multi modal approach can be used to distribute the workload. This paper deals with the use of AR in the Field, especially in a military context. It describes the practical use of AR, the exploratory methodology for creating new cues and gives an outlook on further possible uses.",

The TACTILE project addresses these challenges and fosters an active lifestyle and well-being of older adults via an enjoyable, innovative, and user-friendly Mixed Reality (MR) solution. The system enables training both the cognitive and physical state using MR technology and maintaining social contacts by connecting seniors with family and friends. Cognitive trainings are provided by conventional and physically available board games - such as Ludo - that are completed with virtual game pieces of a remote partner. Since the system uses real physical game pieces, the user experiences a tactile feedback that enables a more familiar feeling and thus novel way of digital interaction. Physical trainings are provided by a virtual avatar that explains and shows dedicated exercises, adaptable to the individual needs and physical restrictions of the user. Thus, the avatar accompanies the user during the physical training in a more natural way.",

The use of communication technologies to visit and explore museums is certainly crucial for increasing visitor attention and helping them improve their museum experience. Due to the rapid development of these technologies, the expectations of tourists have changed, and museums have ceased to exist as product-centered institutions, instead becoming customer-focused in their approaches. This switch has led museums to seek new ways to attract visitors and create interactive experiences. Gamification is a very innovative technology that aims to capture user attention by offering enjoyable and interactive experiences. This chapter attempts to explore the use of gamification as a tool to enhance the attractiveness of museums from the perspective of visitors. We discuss the implementation of gamification in the context of museums' attraction after clarifying what attraction in tourism is as well as the concept of gamification.",

In the new context of the Industry 4.0, vertical and horizontal integration of all participants in the production process is required. A smart factory must have collaborative manufacturing systems that can respond in real-time to meet changing demands and conditions in production process, in the supply chain network and its customer needs. Although the concept and application of the main functionalities of MES systems in the manufacturing processes are those prior to Industry 4.0 and therefore they are not considered as one of the technological pillars that represent it, MES systems perform activities which may be considered prerequisites so 4.0 technologies can be implemented efficiently and effectively. This article intends to describe the relation between the main functionalities of the MES with the technological pillars which are the base of the Industry 4.0. in order to position the strategic role of the MES within this new context and business environment.",

Identifying these components of high risk can inform how resources should be best used on costly modelling tasks. In addition, high risk components may impose functional modelling requirements, which in turn will inform the design of flexible systems for critical areas. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce risk by focusing and informing modelling efforts, which in turn increases the chance of success of the project and lowers costs for all stakeholders involved.",

abstract="A system design for correlating information stimuli and a user's personal information management system (PIMS) is introduced. This is achieved via a deep learning classifier for textual data, a recently developed PIMS graph information architecture, and a principle component analysis (PCA) reduction thereof. The system is designed to return unique and meaningful signals from incoming textual data in or near realtime. The classifier uses a recurrent neural network to determine the location of a given atom of information in the user's PIMS. PCA reduction of the PIMS graph to {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}R{\}}^m{\$}{\$}, with m the actuator (haptic) dimensionality, is termed a PIMS filter. Demonstrations are given of the classifier and PIMS filter. The haptic stimuli, then, are correlated with the user's PIMS and are therefore termed ``metastimuli.'' Applications of this system include educational environments, where human learning may be enhanced. We hypothesize a metastimulus bond effect on learning that has some support from the analogous haptic bond effect. A study is outlined to test this hypothesis.",

abstract="Globalization, technological, social, and cultural progress as well as their consequent Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) shapes a specific environment for modern enterprises. IR4.0 imposes specific challenges and priorities on their behavior, because it creates the so-called SMART WORLD. This observation has raised the following question: How ready are SMEs to be SMART? The main purpose of this chapter is to identify at which stage of preparation for the SMART World are SMEs. The second purpose of the chapter is to identify if and how the size of the enterprise determines the effectiveness of its operation in the age of IR4.0. The studies are based on a literature review and they describe the requirements for organization functioning in the age of IR4.0, a review of international researches and the results of the author's own research on the readiness of SMEs for the SMART World of IR4.0. The findings of the conducted research indicate that the tested SMEs operating in Poland, although increasingly aware of the benefits of the application of modern solutions, still have a too low level of knowledge concerning the requirements of the age of Industry4.0, possess average activity in terms of the use of tools specific to this age, and they are mostly halfway to the SMART world. Furthermore, the bigger the size of a company, the higher the level of readiness for operating in the age IR4.0. At various levels of organizational activity, we can see a growing need for technological, methodical, legal, financial, and social support for such activities.",

abstract="Mobile communication and mobile computing has revolutionized the way subscribers across the globe leverage and use a variety of services on the go. Mobile devices have evolved from mere simple handheld mobile phones that enabled voice calls only a few years back to smartphone devices that enable the user to access applications and value-added services anytime, anyplace. All of these, together with the recent reigniting of cloud computing technology, has spearheaded into the opportunistic and economically viable Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) as the next innovative technology and ultimately a utility wave such as electricity or water. But this has created huge loopholes in facilitating reliable, scalable, performance oriented, safe, secure and auditable trusted services at affordable prices and profitability. Thus, this research proposal aims to create a fully-fledged Mobile Commerce-based Safe Mobile Cloud Computing (MCSMCC) framework to specifically accommodate Safe MCC (SMCC) with economic pricing models and e-trading schemes. As for the safety measures comprising of security, privacy, trust, identity management, audit and digital forensics among other related measures to suit SMCC, the objectives are to define and specify the necessary processes and protocols for secure e-trading, These objectives are further complimented by further defining and specifying SMCC pricing schemes that will be fair and equitable to users and vendors alike, and encourage critical mass market uptake and usage with confidence. Both of these central objectives will be experimented through simulation and prototyping to test and verify their purpose, effectiveness and efficiency.",

Object detection and tracking are the most challenging task faced by different software or computer applications. Especially in dynamic environment for recognizing the living beings is the greatest difficulty faced by applications, as it involves efficient object detection system in environments that are very complex. In image processing, object detection is considered to be a very difficult process. Many solutions for this problem involve the usage of deep learning techniques where a set of data is given to the machine which saves the key features of the objects and help in giving the desired output. This paper describes comprehensive survey on various methods and techniques used for object detection during natural disasters and finally comparative study of different methods are discussed.",

In the last decade a variety of novel user interfaces has been introduced. Both new input and output technologies allow users to communicate with digital artifacts in almost limitless ways. However, our understanding of the human computer interface originates from early HCI research, based on the desktop metaphor, including the user, the system, input and output. This article raises the question, how do we conceptualize user interfaces in our own research and for our teaching. The review reveals that there is no consistent understanding of interface concepts in HCI textbooks and that there is a bias towards the desktop metaphor. As a candidate for an updated interface definition, I propose a revised interface model, including 5 concepts: interface paradigm, interaction technique, interaction style, interface platform and interface device. Finally, I report on two examples, how I have used the interface model in the classroom.",

In fact, product's packaging has recently begun to investigate as one of such interfaces to form a strong link between manufacturers and their end-users. Microprocessors, sensors, actuators and wireless data-exchange supporting chips can be embedded, into packaging design creating an extended user interface -- a touchpoint for a visual, tactile and digital encounter with consumers. Near Field Communication (NFC) is one of the rapidly increasing technologies that researchers begin to investigate as a potential tool for enhanced consumer-brand communication. However, although NFC is available in the market since late 2010, the technology is still not widely applied to the packaging industry. As a result, the main purpose of this research is to investigate the current state-of-the-art and potentials of NFC system. The results of this study provide a systematic review of NFC characteristics, including technological capabilities, consumer- and brand-oriented benefits, and technology- and user-centered potential barriers for NFC to become widely accepted. The findings of this study are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness of NFC-enabled packaging, allowing brands to dynamically adapt to emerging consumer needs by improving their products and services.",

This paper proposed a design concept of multilevel alert takeover information and developed a simulated driving system, and the investigated questionnaires were used to evaluate the takeover performance and user experience. Results show that both levels and channels affect alert efficiency. Multilevel alerts are not able to significantly enhance driving takeover performance but effectively improve user experience. Auditory alert information enables drivers to perceive the risks more quickly, while visual alert information assists drivers to learn about the risk degree more efficiently. It is suggested to add personal experience to motivate the takeover ambitious in further study.",

This paper aims to explore the different and conflicting scholarly debates on authenticity and technology, which lie at the intersection of three fields, namely tourism studies, heritage studies and ICT and which may also have consequences on the actual applicability of such technologies in cultural tourism. An examination of the concept of authenticity in the aforementioned disciplines is provided, through an analysis of how the concept has evolved in each of the three disciplines.

Currently, an SP of project operations is formed by combining information from phone calls, emails and site visits. As a result, the scope, quality and accessibility of the information is weak and does not support supply chain management. Although several studies have been conducted on technologies supporting data capture, data exchange and analysis, a digital SP is still missing in the construction sector. This study aims to advance understanding of how to create a digital SP of construction operations. A digital SP in construction refers to an up-to-date context-specific machine-to-machine readable information, which can be used by different project parties to manage construction operations. The empirical study is conducted in the context of developing supply chain management of prefabricated structural elements by way of interviews and participatory workshops. The findings indicate that specific data, such as -- the identification number of the prefabricated structural element, installation blocks, installation order and its schedule, transport loads and their orders and element statuses -- should be shared in a digital format. The study describes inter-company data flows that are needed to create a digital SP employing seven use cases. These findings contribute to the SP literature in construction by mapping opportunities of a digital SP of construction for supporting efficient construction supply chain management.",

abstract="Structural complexity, a recognized feature of academic writing, has been recently proven by Biber and Gray (Journal of English for Academic Purposes, 9: 2--20, 2010) to be embedded in nominal expressions with phrasal modifiers. However, little has been done to identify the problems that novice Chinese academic writers might face when using nominal expressions to compress information, especially from a functional perspective. This chapter explores the most common phrasal modifier---of--phrases---aiming to find how novice Chinese academic writers in computer science differ from more advanced science writers regarding the discourse-semantic function in which nominal expressions with of-phrases as postmodifiers (NP-of phrases) perform. NP-of phrases retrieved from two self-built corpora of master's thesis abstracts from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and ProQuest were investigated both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our findings show that novice Chinese academic writers use NP-of phrases more frequently but do not compress information as effectively as more advanced writers. For the semantic function, they tend to underuse NP-of phrases with an internal nominalized relationship and overuse some head nouns before of-phrases in certain abstract moves. For the discoursal function, they use fewer NP-of phrases in the verbalized cause--effect relationship, especially in the problemizing step, the result move and conclusion move. These deficiencies may hinder novice Chinese academic writers' ability to produce compact and compelling academic discourse with the meaning-making function of the NP-of phrase enabled by its structural complexity.",

In this study, we decided to only focus on the hand rehabilitation aspect. However, there is a clear tendency in stroke patients to stop training regularly when returning home from the hospital and the first part of their rehabilitation is over. They often experience demotivation, having the feeling that they will never get back to a fully autonomous person ever again and tend to put their training aside, especially when they do not see clear and visible results anymore. This is also due to the supervised training becoming sparser. All of this results in patients stagnating or even worse, regressing.

The presented case study aims to describe the methodological approach and the first concepts developed for the research project that studies an innovative interface system for an autonomous vehicle, able to travel both on the ground and in flight.",

abstract="Cloudlet is introduced to decrease the distance between Main Cloud and mobile users, which directly helps to decrease the latency during game video transmission from the Cloud to mobile users. In this proposed work, a Pre-Stored Cloudlet is introduced. Pre-stored Cloudlet is where the Cloudlet is pre-stored with encoded game videos in it transmitted from the Main Cloud. The main drawbacks of the existing Mobile Cloud Gaming (MCG) are long distances between the Cloud and mobile users, strongly dependent on network, it consumes high bandwidth and causes latency. We proposed a system architecture to overcome the existing problem in MCG by introducing Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc mobile network into the architecture of MCG. Ad Hoc mobile network is formed within the range of Pre-Stored Cloudlets to enable the users to get the pre-rendered game videos from the nearby users. The proposed system has THREE main layers; Cloud, Cloudlet and mobile users and the video transmission is expected to happen between these layers aided with WiMax and WiFi connection. The architecture is implemented through simulation and it is simulated to find the Response Delay which consist of Network Delay, Processing Delay, and Playout Delay. Based on the simulation results obtained, it shows that the introduction of Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc environment has helped to decrease the latency in game video transmission.",

abstract="The theme of this contribution is the world of video games, with particular focus on modern narrative video games whose communicational mode is based on mainly visual forms. In other words, the complexity of these games also regards the ideation of graphical expedients used for communicational purposes in the dynamics of the game. With respect to this field, the studies therefore focus on the theme of visual communication in modern graphical video games, with the goal of investigating different expressive forms. This was addressed on two planes. First, analyses and comparisons were proposed and made among different examples of video games, pausing on some elements of the language and visual grammar. Second, an attempt was made to understand if and how some of the expedients used in this field are really communicational artifices and representational principles used historically in classical and contemporary art, always with a precise intention, that is, to convey a message.",
