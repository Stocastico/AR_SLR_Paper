abstract="The EduPARK is a research and development project that intends to promote interdisciplinary mobile learning, supported by the development of an application to be used in an urban park, providing students' involvement, motivation and engagement to enhance authentic and contextualized learning. The EduPARK project follows a qualitative interpretative methodology fitting in a design-based research, a useful framework for developing technology-enhanced learning resources comprising various cycles of prototype refinement: a game-like app for mobile devices, with Augmented Reality (AR) contents that follows geocaching principles. After those refinement stages, the final version of the app was released for the public in the Google Play Store; and around 50 activities were organized to collect systematic data to better understand mobile learning in outdoor settings, not only in formal but also in non- and informal contexts. To date, EduPARK has involved about 800 students from primary to higher education, 200 teachers and 60 tourists; however, this paper reports a survey study focused particularly on data of participants attending the first four years of primary education. A total of 290 students, organized in 73 teams, completed the game and expressed their opinion about the usability and the educational value of the app in a questionnaire applied after the activity; and automatic app loggings were collected. Results show that the EduPARK app achieved a good usability and has educational value for primary education students. The present work proposes a data collection tool, inspired in Brooke's instrument, regarding the educational value of a game-based mobile AR resource.",

Augmented Reality (AR) experiential technologies offer a unique opportunity for enriching the observations of young pupils with engaging and scientifically valid educational content. This work describes the implementation details of a mobile AR application for astronomy education. A simple but pedagogically sound design and implementation process was followed and a detailed pupil evaluation strategy has been developed. The application has been presented to 15 primary school teachers and evaluated both on cognitive and affective axes. Cognitively, the difficulty of the content has been deemed adequate without challenge spikes, while affectively the application's only weakness has been identified as the lack of strong collaborative and personalization elements. These outcomes shall form the basis for future iterations of this work utilizing a participatory design strategy for a collaborative, personalized educational experience.",

abstract="In the era of evolving technology, the generation who was born in 1995 onwards or known as Gen Z in Malaysia is becoming less interested in knowing and learning about Malay Historical Figures. Currently, the medium or tool applied in learning about Malay Historical Figures is only by using textbook as reference in the classroom. Looking at this scenario, this project attempts to attract their interest in learning historical information, especially about Malay Figure by converting the text or image information into an interactive learning method. The approach for this project is by implementing an augmented reality technology where the interactive fighting game has been embedded. The objectives of this study are to identify the requirements, design and develop Augmented Reality mobile learning application about Malay Historical Figures with the commercial name of ARMyPat (Augmented Reality based in Learning about Malay Patriots). This application prototype will be compatible for the Android platform mobile devices and the target users for this application are students aged between 10 and 15 years old who learn the historical subject at school. The project methodology is ADDIE model that covered analyses, design, develop, implement and evaluation phase since this methodology is suitable for the interactive learning development process. The students can obtain the information such as the summary of character, biodata, heritage and contribution interactively. For 3D character model view, they can learn and know the attraction of the martial art which is Silat. Therefore, they can learn a few movements of the Silat martial art. The last part is an interactive fighting game whereby it can bring the students to the fighting action in real environment and encourage them to know about the heroism characters of that Malay Historical Figure. In the end, this application is to encourage young generation patriotism spirits towards Historical Figure in Malaysia by utilizing augmented reality technology.",

abstract="Scientific inquiry has been recognized as an effective instructions ability for learners in science education. The present study aims to explore the behavioral patterns of the science inquiry learning process and the behavior patterns of conception construction in augmented reality (AR) science learning activities for primary school students. An AR-based inquiry learning activity of ``Exploring the External Conditions of Seed Germination'' was supported, which is an attempt to integrate virtual objects with real situations. Learners utilize the AR based learning materials to accumulate experiences and identify problems while observing and perceiving science concepts. They carry out scientific inquiry based on problems. The scientific inquiry learning can be implemented the following eight-step teaching strategies: constructing environment with AR, revealing misconception under experience, correcting mistakes through AR concepts, obtaining new knowledge by reflection and exploration, establishing the experimental scheme with AR, bringing the scheme to completion by modifying, solving scientific questions through AR, making progress under self-reflection. Students' learning behaviors were analyzed by adopting behavioral sequence analysis. The results suggest that the eight-step teaching strategies may support learners' inquiry learning processes to achieve a positive outcome for their self-efficacy in science inquiry learning.",

The basis is to find studies based on the development of tools for learning programming, which attract a high level of students' attention. The purpose is to carry out an analysis of the main characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of augmented reality as a learning methodology for programming, as well as the tools necessary for its development. After the review, we have found different types of applications which purpose range from business applications, maintenance support and equipment assembly to the development of kinesthetic skills. Regarding the support in learning, this is applied in different areas of study, with very few results in programming. It is intended to make a proposal of an augmented reality model for learning programming. Its high potential in education serves as support for pedagogical activities and the development of cognitive skills. However, there are still problems, such as the dependence of a device with a camera and special capabilities that support its proper functioning. Another impediment is that; the use of technology can be a cause of distraction when teaching a class. Nevertheless, all this with the advance of technology and research related to the subject of study, can certainly be overcome.",

abstract="Augmented Reality (AR) is increasingly used as an educational tool in a range of domains with the goal of enhancing students' performance as well as their learning experience, thanks to the interactivity and visual appeal of AR objects. While some attempts, albeit limited, have been undertaken to prove these beneficial effects in learning 3D geometry, the results remain inconclusive and there are some methodological issues such as under-evaluation of user experience. With the aim to enrich the applied body of knowledge on this specific topic, we developed an AR application that allows its users to learn about cross-sectional shapes and variables in 3D geometry. We compared the AR-based approach with the traditional chalk-and-board approach by involving sixty 12--16 year-olds from two schools. The AR class showed a significantly stronger learning effect than the traditional class, especially for the more complex geometric concepts. The AR class found the application engaging, regardless of their level of knowledge gain, which bore no significant relation with their intention to use it. The methodological challenge for implementing control groups and the practical challenge for affordable emerging educational tools should be tackled in future research.",

However, the AR technology usually requires a corresponding equipment such as a head mounted display (HMD) to display, so its application scope is limited in many aspects. This paper uses the Unity development tools to develop an AR application, which can display three-dimensional (3D) structural models corresponding to different three views of a geometric object on mobile smartphones. During the learning process of engineering drawing, different three views can be scanned by the application, and the corresponding 3D model is automatically restored. By combining the virtual 3D structure with the real world experience, students can better learn engineering drawing courses in the virtual combined environment. The survey results show that the AR application can effectively improve students' understanding and cognizing of 3D objects in engineering drawing learning.",

abstract="Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that allows the perception of the real world. It provides the opportunity for the human being to interact with the objects already created in an environment of a supposed reality. The aim of the RA is to study the digital processing of images, the creation of patterns and the recognition of markers in 3D modeling designs. Through an analysis in a sample of children aged between 3 to 5 years, the advantages, disadvantages that the RA has over them in their cognitive advances with the experience of the objects are identified. Observation, experimental and inductive methods were used, as a result of the project, it was found that children love learning in a more practical, playful and positive way. The use of AR serves to motivate them and encourage them to learn in a meaningful, creative and animated way so that they can grasp and adopt learning as part of their environment. The augmented reality, therefore, offers the possibility of improving the processes of education in children with or without learning problems in the city of Babahoyo.",

abstract="Augmented and Virtual reality proved to be valuable solutions to convey contents in a more appealing and interactive way. Their use is nearly embracing several domains like medicine, geospatial applications, industry, tourism and so on. But among the others, the one that might benefit the most by their use is the Cultural Heritage. In fact, given the improvement of mobile and smart devices in terms of both usability and computational power, contents can be easily conveyed with a realism level never reached in the past. However, despite the tremendous number of researches related with the presentation of new fascinating applications of ancient goods and artifacts augmentation, few papers are focusing on the real effect that these tools have on learning. In fact, whether a disposable use of such tools seems to have a great benefit in terms of visual impact for the users, the same cannot be said about the long-term effect they have on the users, especially for education purposes. Within the framework of SmartMarca project, that will be briefly explained in these pages, this paper focuses on assessing the potential of AR applications specifically designed for Cultural Heritage. More specifically, tests have been conducted on an Augmented Reality experience upon different paintings. For evaluating the benefits of such technology in terms of learning, we have performed our experiment on classrooms of teenagers. By testing different learning approaches, we were able to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of using these technologies for the education process. The paper will even argue on the necessity of developing new tools to enable users to become producers of contents of AR/VR experiences, since up to now there no exists a platform specifically designed for an agile creation, even for not skilled programmers.",

abstract="Autism is a severe disorder affecting 1 in 160 children globally. Autism comprises of several development disabilities such as social, communicational and behavioural challenges. Children being diagnosed by the autism mainly face a hard time studying curriculum in inclusive classrooms based on their IQ level and the autism levels. Although, different strategies and learning teaching tools are available to support autistic children, only few systems aid them in learning efficiently, and are not highly interactive. Thus, the proposed Intelligent Education System primarily focuses on providing interactive learning experience to the autistic children with IQ level >50{\%} and efficient teaching assistance to their tutors using augmented reality and machine learning in both English and Arabic The capability of the education system to perform an action, allows the autistic child to interact with the playable sand and gain interest. In learning stage, once the child scribbles on the sandbox, Kinect 3D camera captures and recognizes the drawn image. After the refinement and recognition of the image using OpenCV and classification model, the stored set of real world object are projected on the canvas. Besides, a webcam captures the facial expression of the child, and emotion detection algorithm determines the reaction of the child. Based on the child's emotion, the current object is projected and pronounced three times to enforce better learning. Once the instructor chooses the language and character to be taught using the developed mobile application, the system displays it over the sandbox and further three objects that starts with the particular character are pronounced and projected. The system is tested rigorously with large set of users, and the results prove the efficiency of the system and happiness of the autistic children in better learning.",

Educational researchers of traditional handicraft have used emergent technologies to inject affective and cognitive learning in teaching. However, numerous studies have highlighted content display of traditional handicraft in teaching based on emergent technologies. As far as we know very little work emphasized personalized learning and experience based on augmented reality in traditional handicraft. In order to address these problems, the researchers present an AR-based experiential learning method for traditional handicraft, with the purpose of shifting the pattern of learning from content-centered to experience-centered. Our approach is Augmented Reality-based Personalized Learning Pattern (ARPLP) for traditional handicraft, and it can be divided into four phases. In addition, a case of Cantonese Porcelain is presented to support this pattern in experience interface of application. The results of research produced an experience interface framework of traditional handicraft based on ARPLP, it contributes to the value of augmented reality as well as experiential learning of students for Cantonese Porcelain.",

Sometime the learning effect is influenced by the delighted value, which is always subjective and learning---driven. In order to ensure successful launch the mobile augment reality of cultural interactive learning tool, it is extremely important to predict the delighted value of design alternatives systematically based on the common language understood by both students and designers. However, the framework for communicating and evaluating such value from interested perspective is not available in the literature. Therefore, the objective of this research is to extract key frameworks of delighted value from interested perspective and develop an effective algorithm to evaluate MAR cultural learning system. First, through literature review and the interview of participants, many scenarios of learning influence were collected. A focus group was invited to identify the essential elements that influence the delighted value of MAR cultural learning system. Followed by a large scale questionnaire survey and factor analysis, four frameworks were extracted. These frameworks, name as CARE framework in brief, included communication, association, reflection, and engagement. Second, the perception differences of MAR cultural learning paper prototypes were conducted to verify the validity of CARE framework for comparative studied. The findings of this study demonstrated that CARE framework was effective for solution designing in MAR cultural interactive learning tool.",

abstract="Teaching introductory computer science is gradually shifting from learning a computer programming language towards acquiring more generic computational thinking skills. At the same time, more emphasis is placed nowadays in natural and playful approaches that can potentially increase student motivation and engagement. One promising such approach is the combination of tangible elements with augmented reality technology, where the instructions can be given in the real world by manipulating physical elements, and the output is presented in a digitally enhanced space. Despite its potential, this approach has not yet been evaluated in formal educational settings. In this paper we present the results from a preliminary study in an elementary school that compared a tangible AR game with the same game in an unplugged version, to examine the effect of the interface on student motivation, effectiveness and teaching practice. The results indicate that a tangible AR approach can improve the engagement and collaboration of students in classroom activities and affects the role of the instructor compared to unplugged activities.

The assessment is conducted as a series of tasks in which participants are asked to associate a printed word with its corresponding picture and ArSL. The findings show that participants who were taught via the AR application completed significantly more tasks successfully and with significantly fewer errors compared to participants who were taught the new words via a traditional approach.

abstract="Agritourism is an extension of ecotourism, which encourages visitors to experience agricultural life at firsthand. The growing interest in this industry worldwide poses new challenges to the environment. Traditional tourism models have somehow endangered local biodiversity and, consequently, it is necessary to promote new models that include education. Eco-education is commonly conducted through passive learning approaches within educational institutions, which often result in poor student performance in real life. Therefore, it is necessary to generate active methodologies to enrich learning experiences. Augmented Reality holds the power to add multiple benefits to the learning processes. Accordingly, this study introduces ``ARtour''. ARtour combines an Augmented Reality experience with on-site experiences to learn about agritourism while encourages tourists to maintain responsible environmental behavior. The project considers two outdoor learning scenarios: aquaponics and subsistence crops. We posit that ARtour will enhance outdoor learning experiences and will be a useful guide to promote agritourism.",

Our initial research identifies a gap in the perceptions of STEM students between the usefulness of discipline based modules and a compulsory `Professional Development' module where more `employability' based skills were delivered. It had a history of poor student engagement and attendance, and failed to provide a compelling narrative/links to the outside world. The AR tasks were designed to facilitate group-working and multi-channel communication, and to engage students through the use of a more creative technology. Framed as a rich case study, insights are captured through student blogs, video interviews and a questionnaire. Initial findings indicate higher levels of satisfaction, enhanced student engagement and a greater awareness of the value of transferable skills.",

abstract="In recent years the development of technologies which enhance the perceptual experience of the physical environment has progressed significantly. Along with this advancement rose also the curiosity and acceptance of people toward interacting with computer-generated elements and nowadays this interesting concept called Augmented Reality (AR) is starting to be present in nearly every aspect of humans life. Although AR is predominantly known for its entertainment, gaming character, within the time it has transformed into a publicly available, scalable tool which can be used in a more serious context. In 2015, a collaboration between Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab, Changing Places Group, and the German city of Hamburg introduced a practical use of AR in urban planning. This case study presents a project Finding Places (FP) - an idea of applying games into an AR-assisted participatory method in regard to solving a complex, sensible urban challenge, resulted in creating a unique decision-making tool with entertaining, which may have a chance to grow into a consequent, urban development practice. First of all, it introduces the reader with the subject of moderation methods of urban participatory events, applied game, and the Geospatial AR (GeoAR) through. Secondly, through case's study analysis and following discussion examine the efficiency and usability aspects of such aided planning approach. The goal of this work is to show the possibilities that instruments like the GeoAR could give in the context of urban planning and to encourage diverse city stakeholders to experiment with innovative, resource-saving, digital tools.",

abstract="The relationship between poor air quality and ill health concerns citizens and health practitioners the world over. An increasing number of Air Quality Data (AQD) apps quantify air quality numerically, yet many of us remain confused about the `real' extent of air pollution, in part because we tend to ignore imperceptible pollution despite data alerting us to its danger. Further, even if we understand it, data about air quality alone does not sustain citizens' interest in environmental issues. We report on our use of Augmented Reality (AR) to create an app that visualizes AQD as an affective miniature tree whose health corresponds to live AQD. We argue that AR is polyaesthetic, demanding a more embodied engagement from its users which deepens their understanding of AQD. Our participatory design study with 60 users shows the salience of using locally relevant imagery and working with users as co-designers to add features that support social interaction to design an app that gamifies citizens' interactions with AQD.",

Differences in age groups included reduced relevant prior knowledge and developmental differences in concrete versus abstract reasoning and problem solving as well as self-regulation and motivation. Using direct observation and focus group interviews, we identified modifications that seemed effective and others that needed additional refinement.

The project addresses tourism changes in the digital age; the ubiquitous use of smartphones alters a tourist's travel experience, from accessing timetables to conveying cultural and historic information or transforming traditional souvenirs. ``Tales on Rails'' tested a smartphone application allowing tourists to play a game about a crime story on the route between the cities of Lucerne and Interlaken, which is operated by the Swiss railways company zb Zentralbahn AG. The game directly references the environment outside the train on this route as well as cultural themes about the region. The game's progress is linked to the position of the train, successively unlocking its content on the route. The game is tailored for use by 20 to 30-year-old leisure travellers, and optimized for a group experience in which two to four players collaborate on solving the game; thus, group dynamics during the gaming experience could be investigated. The game features a technologically ambitious program with augmented reality game elements, while minimizing negative impacts on playability by environmental influences such as seasonal and weather conditions. The technical complexity of the concept could be expanded in future iterations. The project ``Tales on Rails'' was released in July 2019 as fully functional game application in the Google Play Store and the Apple Store.",

abstract="This paper addresses how Augmented Reality (AR) can be used as a tool to provide a different dimension to the museum experience, by furbishing the actual environment with extra information, which enables users to have a different perception of reality. When integrating both the concepts of AR and Experience, the authors discovered that this could be a powerful tool for museums, which have to grapple with the question of how to engage their visitors and present information in a captivating way. Therefore an AR application prototype was developed. Museum visitors were subsequently invited to participate in an experiment, which had the objective of gauging the value of AR and whether or not it made a significant difference towards the museum experience. On the whole, this paper aims to show how technology can be used in the curation process, by facilitating and enhancing the presentation of exhibits in a museum.",

abstract="This paper explores the User Experience (UX) of Augmented Reality applications in museums. UX as a concept is vital to effective visual communication and interpretation in museums, and to enhance usability during a museum tour. In the project `MuseumEye', the augmentations generated were localized based on a hybrid system that combines of (SLAM) markerless tracking technology and the indoor Beacons or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). These augmentations include a combination of multimedia content and different levels of visual information that required for museum visitors. Using mobile devices to pilot this application, we developed a UX design model that has the ability to evaluate the user experience and usability of the application. This paper focuses on the multidisciplinary outcomes of the project from both a technical and museological perspective based on public responses. A field evaluation of the AR system was conducted after the UX model considered. Twenty-six participants were recruited in Leeds museum and another twenty participants in the Egyptian museum in Cairo. Results showed positive responses on experiencing the system after adopting the UX design model. This study contributes on synthesizing a UX design model for AR applications to reach the optimum levels of user interaction required that reflects ultimately on the entire museum experience.",

abstract="The paper reports on the design of an augmented reality (AR) application for structural analysis education. Structural analysis is a significant course in every civil engineering program. The course focuses on load and stress distributions in buildings, bridges, and other structures. Students learn about graphical and mathematical models that embody structures as well as to utilize those models to determine the safety of a structure. An often reported obstacle is the missing link between these graphical models and a real building. Students often do not see the connection, which hinders them to utilize the models correctly. We designed an AR application that superimposes real buildings with graphical widgets of structural elements to help students establishing this link. The focus of this study is on application design, especially on the question whether students prefer an application that guides them when solving an engineering problem or whether the students prefer to explore. Students were asked to solve a problem with the application, which either instructed them step-by-step or allowed the students to use all feature on their own (exploring). The results are inconclusive, however, tend to favor the explore mode.",

abstract="Augmented reality (AR) projects typically involve interactive systems that align virtual objects with the real world. This process is called registration and can make it seem as if virtual objects existed in the otherwise real environment. Registration is widely accepted as a defining and necessary characteristic of augmented reality. In this paper, we reconsider the need for registration on two levels. First of all, we argue that the intended presence of virtual objects in real space can be achieved without registration by an interactive AR system. Secondly, we suggest that the perceived spatial presence of virtual content in real space is not necessary for AR in the first place. We illustrate both points with examples and propose a more encompassing view of AR that focuses on relationships between the virtual and the real rather than on registration.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose a new augmented reality approach allowing novices to easily and quickly augment real objects with audio feedback. In our user study, six teachers created their own audio-augmentation of objects, such as a botanical atlas, within 30 min or less. Teachers found the tool easy to use and were confident about re-using it. The resulting augmented objects allow two modes: exploration mode provides feedback on demand about an element, while quiz mode provides questions and answers. We evaluated the resulting audio-tactile material with five visually impaired children. Participants found the resulting interactive graphics exciting to use independently of their mental imagery skills.",

abstract="In recent years, the use of technology to help children for augmented and alternative communication (AAC) is extremely a vital task. In this paper, a novel three-dimensional human-computer interaction application is presented based on augmented reality (AR) technology for assisting children with special problems in communication for social innovation. To begin with, three-dimensional human hand model is constructed to estimate and track the hand's position of users. An extended particle filter is applied for calculating the pose of background and the positions of children. The likelihoods based on the edge map of the image and pixel color values are utilized to estimate the joint likelihood in three-dimensional model. A flexible real-time hand tracking framework using the `golden energy' scoring function is integrated for capturing region of interests. An inertial tracking technique is used for calculating the quaternion. Three-dimensional models from Google SketchUp are employed. We then use a built QR-code for scanning to access the system, and then utilize for selecting a character three-dimensional designed cartoon by applying the Vidinoti image application. After that, representative three-dimensional cartoons and augmented environments are overlaid, so that it is able to entertain children. A printed coloring photo, called Augmented Flexible Tracking is designed and provided in the system for visualization. The process of the system is done in real-time. Our experiments have revealed that the system is beneficial both quantitatively and qualitatively for assisting children with special needs in communication interactively.",

Instead of having a learner physically direct a hand-held camera toward an object of interest, and then view the display screen, a group of participants can gather around the display system and directly see and manipulate the thermal profile projected onto physical objects. The system combines a thermal camera that captures the thermal data, a depth camera that realigns the data with the objects, and a projector that projects the data back. We also apply a colour scale tailored for room temperature experiments.",

abstract="The direct fundoscopy examination procedure involves interpreting the intricate anatomy of the eye when viewed through the lens of an ophthalmoscope. Mastering this procedure is difficult, and it requires extensive training that still employs instructional materials including pictures, illustrations, videos, and more recently, interactive computer-generated models. With the goal of adding realism to eye fundus training and overcoming the limitations of traditional media, the simulators employing manikin heads can be used. Such simulations utilize interchangeable pictures and embedded displays that allow the presentation of various eye conditions. Modern simulators include immersive technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality that are providing innovative training opportunities. Unfortunately, current high end virtual and augmented reality simulation is quite expensive and for more adequate experience, it engages only single trainee at a time. This paper addresses the question of whether lower end simulation systems could provide comparable training experiences at an affordable cost. With respect to this, we discuss the design and development of two augmented reality systems for eye fundus examination training employing low-cost mobile platforms. We conclude with reporting that some preliminary results of the experimental use of the systems include usability perception feedback and comparisons with the Eyesi simulator.",

abstract="This study examines how cognitive processes that support mission planning are influenced by the physical ability to touch and manipulate sand, compared to passively observing the same action. It employs a systematic investigation on terrain conceptual knowledge, terrain recognition and, landmark memory using the ARES sand table. Sand tables are topographic models that support learning through the physical creation of scenarios. In the military, sand tables support strategic exercises for soldiers to practice the process of collective decision making and communication. Operational mission planning typically occurs with one person shaping the sand, followed by a larger group of individuals observing. It is the relationship between the person shaping terrain and those observing that is of specific interest. A total of 96 participants were recruited, from the University of Central Florida (UCF) and the Center for Applied Brain {\&} Cognitive Sciences (CABCS). Results indicate that physically shaping the terrain improved recognition but did not have an effect on conceptual knowledge or recollection of landmarks compared to observers. This experiment supports the need for further investigation to determine how tangible interaction can contribute to cognitive understanding.",

abstract="Australian building and construction education takes place in the Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector. Institutions have attempted to develop new mobile learning (m-learning) tools to improve pedagogy and construction compliance outcomes. However, m-learning tools continue to have a low uptake in this sector, which is typified by face-to-face and conventional internet-based blended learning. The Collaborative Research Centre for Low Carbon Living Project RP3015 (CRCLCL RP3015) aimed to design, develop, and test a new m-learning prototype application, and this involved a range of fieldwork activities and collaborative workshops with key stakeholders. The aim of the research project was to increase knowledge in this sector and motivate collaborative action on residential compliance with the energy efficiency measures set out in the national construction code. By failing to account for the low uptake of mobile learning by students and faculty and failing to conduct fieldwork on the actual practices of trade apprentices and design appropriate prototypes, the project did not succeed in producing a working application. In this paper, we focus on the learning and educational preliminaries to effective mobile learning (m-learning) design and pedagogy innovation for formal vocational education and informal learning in the workplace. We also focus on the learning from failure opportunity of the project.",

To provide adults with better understanding about the infants' encounters with surrounding objects by visualization of actual recoded data, the study comprised three steps. First, we conducted longitudinal observations of 10 infants (6 males, 4 females), aged 4--12 months, at their homes in Tokyo, Japan. Second, we developed an AR application for iPhones and iPads, by using vision-based marker tracking technique. Based on the observations, 10 most frequently observed objects were adapted as markers for AR. To ensure privacy and to focus on infant--object interactions, we converted all AR movies to line drawings. Third, we conducted informal user interviews and user tests to confirm the method's validity and usability. The longitudinal observational data shed light on the infants' perceptions and actions, helping to clarify not only developmental possibilities but also risks of accidents. The user interview suggested that our prototype could scope out the home from infants and can help adults to obtain insights for encouraging child development and reevaluating childproofing home as an ongoing process.",

abstract="Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in adults is characterized by gradual memory loss for old age people. Alzheimer's brain have impact on affecting brain, include loss of memory, difficulty in thinking, language and solving problems symptoms. Heart issues, depression, diabetes and high blood pressure pose a higher risk of causing Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's disease in the brain proteins build up to form structures known as plaques, which are the abnormal clumps in the brain, and tangles which are the bundles of fibbers in the brain. This leads to loss of brain tissue, nerve cells connections and lead to death of nerve cells. In their brain there is a shortage of chemicals. These chemical messengers around the brain help to transmit signals whose shortage causes the signals do not transmit effectively. The above symptoms were visualized as AR (Augmented Reality) model to assist doctors for medical analysis. Augmented Reality act as a extremity tool for findings, supporting and analyse the Alzheimer's Disease. Understanding the AR brain model enhance the analysis of the brain with the technical exploration of tracking, visualization technology layer by layer level, integrated feedback about different parts of the brain function which plays a major role in clinical evaluation to treat the Alzheimer's disease. Microglia are a type of cell that initiate immune responses in the brain and spinal cord. When AD is present, microglia interpret the beta-amyloid plaque as cell injury. To reduce or control the inflammatory response and brain shrinking can be visualized using Augmented Reality.",

abstract="Audiovisual production, which was previously mostly investigated by film and television studies, now becomes more comprehensive and can involve aspects of psychology, pedagogy, neuroscience and especially computing. In parallel to this evolution, studies on Universal Access or Universal Design have been expanding their scope for services, technologies and learning processes. This article presents a systematic literature review with the objective of investigating the main uses and applications of Computer Human Interaction (IHC) theories and methods related to the development of audiovisual systems and their possible contributions to Universal Design for Learning (UDL). The review contemplates articles from four databases in the period from 2010 to 2018. All 31 articles are classified by the context of the research problems and solutions proposed using principles of the grounded theory, that is, the codification of data through hierarchical categorization, establishment of relation and creation of central categories. These works are divided into three main groups of problems (user interfaces, theoretical and behavioral bases and system application) and solutions (theories and methods, design and evaluation of interactive systems and case studies). HCI state of the art productions and methods using audiovisual systems, i.e. audio and video, multimedia, hypermedia or even multimodal systems, has revealed a scenario of products, devices and interaction methods that have evolved and become more complex over the years. While not working directly with the Universal Design context, the various solutions present results that can benefit the development of learning support systems.",

abstract="Mixed reality environments as in-betweens of real-world and virtual-reality (VR) environments are created by combining real world objects with computer generated ones. In general, mixed-reality along with VR technology provides innovative ways of showing relationships and connections in the real world, mainly by complimenting real objects with additional information (text, audio and video overlays). In Science Technology and Engineering (STE) disciplines, collaborative learning is about learners working together in teams or groups on structured learning tasks, that typically have a clearly defined goal and are arranged in such a manner that all members of the team are involved. A collaborative approach builds individual and group accountability in each learner as well as one or more soft skills such as communicating with peers, managing resources and the ability to make decisions. This paper presents the use of mixed-reality environments for personalised learning along with two approaches based on message passing paradigms for implementing collaborative learning in mixed-reality environments. The first approach shows the use of a pair of geographically distant mixed-reality environments for remote collaborative learning, while the second approach show multiple (independent) mixed-reality tools synchronised for co-located group work/learning. The statistical analysis of a research study with over 70 respondents from STE disciplines who were exposed to mixed-reality tools developed using mobile technology is also presented and discussed in the context of collaborative work within mixed-reality environments. The contributions includes unique implementations of mixed-reality based collaborative learning environments capable of providing similar experience to that obtained from traditional real-world environments.",

abstract="The use of medical equipment may be compromised by the lack of knowledge of users about important information and operational characteristics that may cause adverse events. Clinical engineering has as an important function to guide and qualify users in adapting to the use of technology to obtain safer and more reliable health technology processes. The new augmented reality tools, whose main objective is to overlap virtual information in reality through technology, are a good alternative to develop solutions focused on the orientation and qualification of users. This paper presents a proposal to develop a platform for support in the orientation and teaching of medical device users. With this augmented reality platform, through the use of mobile devices, the user can access in real-time information on procedures of adjustments, characteristics, ways of use and control of the medical equipment. This prototype developed for the pulmonary ventilator uses augmented reality in order to enhance its interactions with computer applications more naturally, it seeks to present information about the different ventilation modes, equipment initialization procedures and interactive contents to the user through links and videos. Modern pulmonary ventilators present challenges to users due to the need of knowledge, such as configurations and ways of using parameters; the patient's trigger in the assisted ventilation mode; use of assisted aspiration; pressure alarm setting. These actions are not usually carried out adequately generating possible adverse events, being this situation one of the main objectives of the use of the technology in the platform for the user support. The preliminary results obtained in this prototype characterize this solution as a support tool for activities developed by Clinical Engineering to improve processes in health care.",

abstract="Interactive 3D techniques offer a new quality in the design of user interfaces of computer applications, in particular when 3D applications are accessible remotely over the internet. A critical element for building practical 3D applications is adequate 3D synthetic content. However, designing high-quality interactive 3D content is a complex and challenging task. This difficulty is one of the major obstacles preventing widespread use of 3D techniques on the web in many promising application domains. In this paper, a new approach to 3D content creation is presented. The approach employs a range of techniques for simplification of the content creation process, but its main novelty lies in the fact that properly structured content can be created by communities of designers, regardless of whether they explicitly collaborate or not. Appropriate organization and consistency of the user-contributed content is enforced by the use of semantic web techniques with external domain ontologies. The presented approach is consistent both with the existing content creation pipelines and business models, aiming at enhancing and not replacing the current practices in digital content creation. A prototype of a tool for 3D content design implemented as an extension to the Unity IDE is also presented.",

They've gone beyond entertainment needs, and the computer game paradigm and technology together are now increasingly used in education, training, storytelling, and wherever it's necessary to create an appealing and engaging environment. More realism in virtual and artificial environments and more real interfaces to the users can be considered as two main advantages that we get using these techniques. Instead of pre-defined hard coded scripts driving these environments, we will be able to create just the environment and its relative mechanics, so the artificial intelligence could introduce tailored challenges and scenarios to the environment. This paper proposes a Behavioral Driven Procedural Content Generation methodology together with Ternary Neural Networks to be used in interactive strategy-based simulations for effective decision making. This is vital because current approaches like Experience Driven Procedural Content Generation algorithms can be very flexible and one small change could trigger complex changes in the system.

abstract="Effective ways of presenting digital data are needed to augment a user's experience in the real world without distracting or overloading them. We propose a system of systems approach for the design, development, and evaluation of information presentation devices, particularly augmented reality devices. We developed an evaluation environment that enables the synchronized presentation of multimodal stimuli and collection of user responses in an immersive environment. We leveraged visual, audio, thermal, and tactile information presentation modalities during a navigation and threat identification task. Twelve participants completed the task while response time and accuracy data were collected. Results indicated variability among devices and pairs of devices, and suggested that information presented by some pairs of devices was more effective and easily acted upon than that presented by others. The results of this work provided important guidance regarding future design decisions and suggest the utility of our system of systems approach. Implications and future directions are discussed.",

abstract="Many systems and applications have been developed to help visitors get around the museum and interact with the items on exhibition. However, most of the existing systems are developed to serve as a virtual tour guide and/or provide additional digital information using Augmented Reality techniques. Little attention has been paid to enabling visitors to interact with each other and share their experience with outsiders. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of a prototype of a museum touring application called SMART. This system was designed to explore how mobile devices can be used to connect museum visitors and their friends. It is intended to be a smart and novel mobile application that enables groups of museum visitors to select tours by their preferences, display relevant information about their tour and objects, provide interactive activities for tourists and let them mark their favourite exhibits. It also aims to streamline traditional museum tours by providing more interesting, more meaningful and more interactive parts to the tour.",

The traditional editorial design has had to adapt to the new digital media composition, where multimedia audiovisual elements unthinkable a few years ago need to be integrated. The participation of the reader, as an external observer who only receives information through texts and images, now has new scenarios in which he can actively participate and decide what will come to his hands. In this study, a work methodology based on UxD User Experience Design is presented, in which will generate the editorial design of an educational book on environmental issues, which includes augmented reality for children from 6 to 8 years of age. The aim of this study is to know if an editorial product with augmented reality and developed from the user experience design can improve meaningful learning in a playful and active way. For its development, a composition model based on the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio will be used. Additionally, its graphic composition will be guided by the Massimo Vignelli canon and will be complemented by the reticular model of Beth Tondreau. The augmented reality markers position will also be based on the composition model previously mentioned, which will allow keeping the attention of the reader in the printed document and in the augmented reality animations. The user experience design will be applied with teachers, parents and students from 4 schools in Quito and Ambato. Once the production is completed, the impact on teaching-learning process will be evaluated with a control and a test group, and the methodology with which they will work in the classroom with the educational material developed will be defined. At the end of the study, copies of the book will be delivered to the participating schools of this research for its implementation.",

The effective participants included 70 pre-service and 50 in-service teachers. Through data analysis of effective participants from the perspectives of gender and experience, we found that 1) Pre-service teachers are more sensitive to social influences than in-service teachers are. For all the participants, 2) Male teachers are more sensitive to social influences than females. 3) Effort expectancy has a negative impact on AR behavioral intention of high-experience teachers.

abstract="Nowadays, children are becoming familiarized with mobile devices from very young ages, having their first contact with them even under their 2nd year of age. Also, a lot of discussion is being made regarding the integration of mobile applications in educational settings, formal and informal. A very common concern of both the educators and the parents of children aged 4--6 years old is ``what is out there for my children to use?''. Although this is being dealt with for several years for older ages, there is not much work regarding this age-group. Based upon this fundamental question, this paper attempts to examine the availability of mobile applications which can be exploited by teachers in Early Childhood Education. Specifically, the focus of the paper is the Greek Kindergarten which is attended by children aged 4--6 six years old and Android based mobile devices. A thorough survey in Google Play was carried out in order to record all the corresponding results which were then categorized and discussed upon. Furthermore, the paper tries to shed light to the perspective of an inexperienced teacher who has the means and the will to integrate mobile devices in his/her classroom, by identifying the challenges that he/she will face during such an attempt. Thus, this paper aims at serving as a reference point for those who wish to initiate their trip in the mobile learning world by discussing all the aspects and the difficulties of such an attempt.",

abstract="User-perspective rendering in Video See-through Augmented Reality (V-AR) creates a view that always shows what is behind the screen, from the user's point of view. It is used for better registration between the real and virtual world instead of the traditional device-perspective rendering which displays what the camera sees. There is a small number of approaches towards user-perspective rendering that over all improve the registration between the real world, the video captured from real world that is displayed on the screen and the augmentations. There are still some registration errors that cause misalignment in the user-perspective rendering. One source of error is from the device registration which, based on the used tracking method, can be the misalignment between the camera and the screen and also the tracked frame of reference that the screen and the camera are attached to it. In this paper we first describe a method for the user perspective V-AR based on 3D projective geometry. We then address the device registration problem in user perspective rendering by presenting two methods: First, for estimating the misalignment between the camera and the screen. Second, for estimating the misalignment between the camera and the tracked frame.",

Ongoing technological advances in MxR have expanded its potential usage by military analyst teams to view, digest, and evaluate information from multiple data sources for uncovering adversarial behavior. Towards facilitating improved situational awareness, MxR is a promising medium for explaining patterns in data to uncover vital information. By extension, analyst collaborations conducted using MxR may further enhance collaborative decision making techniques used in military settings. In general, explanations provide summarizations or descriptive information that supports conclusions, depending on the desired level of abstraction. However, explanations that summarize information may not always preserve the underlying uncertainty present in the data. This work proposes a fused reason-based explanation technique for MxR that may help bring clarity to data where patterns may be unexpected, potentially revealing adversarial behavior.",

AR uses a ``marker'' which is a tangible mechanism to interact with the digital contents. However the problem for visualizing becomes limited as the user needs to focus more on the marker rather than the digital contents. To improve this problem, we designed a dynamic simulation software tool that allows the user to interact using multiple interactive functions on a single paper for a four-bar linkageFour-Bar Linkages (4BL)mechanisms (4BL) problem. A preliminary test of the new user interface found that users could focus more on the contents rather than the interaction mechanism. The results and a discussion on the comparative of marker based and multiple touch functions are provided in this paper.",

Issues highlighted include the ethics of telling other people's stories in the IN medium, the myth of the designer as impartial facilitator, the power structures of different types of design processes, and complexities of large scale projects that incorporate emergent technology, contested histories, and a wide range of stakeholders and participants. Lessons learned are shared in the form of a set of guidelines to help shape design and development of interactive narrative projects in educational, museum, and heritage settings.",

abstract="Augmented and virtual reality in combination with robotics offers unique design opportunities centered around novel human machine collaboration. The coordination of these tools allows for unique modes of collaborative design, sensory stimulation and strategic deception. In this paper, we outline the components and calibration of a collaborative environment which coordinates industrial robotics, mobile augmented reality, and virtual reality. This technical setup allows for multiple modes of experimentation, encouraging reflection on the larger domain of human-robotic collaboration. As such, this work facilitates the definition of four discrete modes of robotic collaboration: Stop-Gap Collaboration, Manual-Assist Collaboration, Creative Collaboration, and Environmental Collaboration. Stop-Gap Collaboration uses humans to bridge technical gaps in automated systems. Manual-Assist Collaboration uses digital tools to augment the human execution of technical tasks. Creative Collaboration prioritizes creative expression, while Environmental Collaboration considers humans as agents in occupied and continuously evolving robotic environments. As robotics gains prominence in design and manufacturing, it becomes increasingly important to examine the role of human beings in partially automated workflows---prioritizing creativity and environmental adaptivity in design applications.",

abstract="Mathematical experiences are intrinsic to our everyday lives, yet mathematics education is mostly confined to textbooks. Seymour Papert used the term `Mathland' to propose a world where one would learn mathematics as naturally as one learns French while growing up in France. We built a Mixed Reality application that augments the physical world with interactive mathematical concepts to enable constructionist mathematical learning in the real world. Using Mathland, people can collaboratively explore, experience and experiment with mathematical phenomena in playful, applied and exploratory ways. We implemented Mathland using the Microsoft Hololens and two custom controllers to afford complete immersion through tangible interactions, embodiment and situated learning. Our preliminary study with 30 participants shows that a considerable percentage of participants found Mathland to not only be engaging (83{\%}), but also efficacious in the areas of collaborative learning (92.8{\%}), problem solving (96.6{\%}) and mathematics education (90{\%}).",

abstract="Serious games are increasingly used to facilitate stakeholder discussion and collaboration. Much attention is given in the game design literature on how to choose and design a serious game's scope, content, mechanics, and link to reality in order to achieve the game's intended learning outcomes. In this paper, we focus on how a serious game's interface and the interaction it elicits contributes to achieving learning outcomes. We do so in the context of the Virtual River, a serious game focused on river management. Following the design and evaluation of a paper prototype of the Virtual River, a design challenge arose as the highly simplified models of reality used was perceived as a black box by non-expert participants, while expert participants perceived it as oversimplified and unrealistic. As hydrodynamic models used in river management practice are in itself perceived by non-experts as a black box, we decided to look for ways to simplify the interaction with such models in the game. Here, we present a tangible user interface for the Virtual River. The interface enables participants to get a better grip on the hydrodynamics of a river system. The system is set up as a discussion platform where the game board and its tangible game pieces help participants express their thoughts and ideas. We argue that using tangible interaction in Virtual River contributes to social learning outcomes by providing hypotheses based on literature and present how we intend to test these hypotheses.",

abstract="Molecular docking is increasingly considered as a key tool for lead discovery of structure-based drug design. While huge ligand-receptor combinations, intangible microcosmic molecular world and complex docking scoring are the major challenges for modern molecular docking. In this paper, we present an edugame called ARDock, which is a web-based and interactive molecular docking game. The web-based feature allows multiple participants to engage in the game and provides solutions to complex scientific problems. Augmented reality is imported and consequently molecular docking process becomes tangible. The relative positions of two molecules are instantly updated with the users' operation, enabling the spatial locating capabilities of humans. The optimized scoring function is proposed to reduce the computation complexity, and the message-oriented middleware facilitates real-time communication between the browsers and the server. The overall framework and detailed designs are illustrated. Some combination strategies make this edugame more interesting, which in return can attract more users and enhance their continuous participation. Sufficient user evaluations validate the usability of this game. This work is a step to promote the popularization of molecular docking knowledge.",

Six designs were iteratively developed. In total 26 older adults, with a mean age of 71 ({\textpm}7), participated in the user studies. Although no time benefits were observed, participants perceived MeViTa as an effective means to explore and understand medication information, and as more engaging than the traditional patient information leaflet.

Yet, despite their great potential for education, the use of MLGs by teachers, remains limited. This is partly due to the fact that MLGs are often designed to match a specific learning context, and thus cannot be reusable for other contexts. Therefore, researchers have recently designed various types of MLG authoring tools. However, these authoring tools are not always adapted to non-computer-scientists or non-game-designers. Hence, we propose in this paper to focus on five existing MLG authoring tools, in order to assess their features and usability with the help of five teachers, who are used to organizing educational field trips. In the second part of this paper, we present an approach for designing a MLG authoring tool, based on the lacks identified through the analysis, and tailored to the teachers' different profiles and needs.",

As mobile devices and new social communication trends are increasingly integrating in the modern digital lifestyle new opportunities arise for harnessing this potential for innovative serious purposes. Location-based games that layer educational activities with game play can help players gain a new perspective through active engagement. In this paper, a range of key issues for implementing location based games for educational purposes using the two most commonly used open source authoring tools ARIS and TaleBlazer are presented. Although the reviewed authoring tools vary in functionality, they share a fairly common conceptual model and in both cases the software architecture is comprised of the same components. Both platforms provide the required game mechanics to create sophisticated gameplay interactions and game logic extension. However, a number of issues should be carefully considered. The conceptual models are analyzed with a critical view, pointing out limitations and challenges that can inform the design and implementation of next generation authoring tools.",

abstract="Various attempts have been made to teach first aid to the general public on how to deal with disaster medical situations, such as sending firemen to schools to give talks and hand out instructional pamphlets. But it is hard to determine whether the message is really getting through, or whether the students attend just because they have to. Now we have come up with a novel IT-based interactive educational tool based on a medutainment (medical edutainment) model for teaching basic first aid techniques to the public. Our initial assessment shows that this new medutainment-based approach is very effective for teaching first aid and disaster medicine to large numbers of people in situations where cost-effective experience-based training is impractical or not available.",

This paper highlights early intervention through identification of dyscalculia learners in a national elementary school. The identification of dyscalculia learners was done through a screening instrument that combined of Mathematics Learning Ability (MLA) and Mathematics Learning Performance (MLP). The findings categorised the learners based on five main difficulties namely, memory, abstraction, sequencing processing, motor, and visual perception. However, the visual perception category showed most significant difficulty faced by dyscalculia learners in learning mathematics. The findings were used as initial analysis for Systems Requirement Specifications (SRS) that would be used to design and develop a visual-based fusion technology AR application for dyscalculia learners.",

abstract="History as a school subject is difficult for young pupils, especially when teaching is based on bulky texts and lacks audio-visual auxiliary material. This paper presents a differentiated teaching proposal based on the use of the playful activity `3D Heroes Introduce Themselves' (3D HIT). It is based on the projection of 3d models on mobile devices as augmented spreads on images included in a worksheet. Together with the manipulation of 3d models, students are invited to create digital stories with relevant information. Thus, a final video is created in which heroes and mythical figures from the History subject introduce themselves with the voice of the pupils. The contribution of the activity to the students' performance and the level of engagement and participation was examined in this study. Also, whether the production of digital narratives in combination with the manipulation of 3d models reinforced the expressiveness of pupils was examined. Observation-based data indicated interesting positive results.",

However, some of natural processes take a long time while some scientific processes happen at high-speed, making it difficult for children to observe only with their bare eye. Additionally, there is a lack of interaction and exploring interests for children to watch traditional videos. In order to help children learn long-period natural phenomena and high-speed scientific processes, a Time-based Nonlinear Interactive Player (TNIP) is designed. Children are able to control the playback direction and playback speed by moving the mouse left or right and quickly or slowly. The selecting of frame range and frames depend on the drag speed of mouse so as to make the interactive playback smooth. In the aspect of immersive experience, schema integration, real-time feedback and learning interesting, TNIP has the prominent learning advantages over other common instructional media. TNIP could promote the education of children in terms of scientific processes at a deep cognitive level.",

While students in all groups worked in pairs, the first used the textbooks, the second used computers and the third was taught exclusively through the use of tablets and micro-applications developed by the class's teacher. The learning outcomes of the third group were equally good compared to the ones of the second, while both groups outperformed the first one. No notable differences regarding students' misconceptions were observed. The results can be attributed to a number of factors such as students' increased motivation and autonomy, but also highlight the need for finding more efficient methods for integrating tablets into the teaching process.",

abstract="During cooperative interaction, participants introduce materials, artefacts, and other individuals into the ongoing interaction. Depending on how this introduction unfolds, the participants may embrace the new element in an easy way or not. If the new element is a collaborative application of interactive software designed to support the interaction, it may or may not improve the collaboration because of how it was introduced. Therefore, understanding and designing the initial interaction is key for unleashing the positive impact of collaborative systems. The literature has identified the fact that humans employ a specific range of behaviors when introducing an element into an ongoing interaction. Those introduction rituals are determined by whether the new element is a human or a material artefact. Introduction rituals involving interactive elements are still underexplored: How do participants introduce and initiate interaction with them? This manuscript explores the introduction behaviors emerging when an augmented-reality collaborative application is being introduced into a financial advisory service. It shows that the participants employ a wider range of introduction rituals during the introduction of this application than they do when they introduce a brochure. Notably, many of the observed behaviors resemble familiar opening rituals typically used when introducing and greeting humans. This supports the computers-are-social-actors argument and provides evidence that introducing a collaborative application has a social rather than a material character.",

abstract="History education offers students the opportunity to learn about the past and make connections with the present. However, primary school students consider history lessons to be boring, dull and sterile. Integrating ICT in history teaching can enhance historical thinking and historical understanding, and may promote the exploration of the past with a critical approach rather than the passive accumulation of information. The objective of this study was to design and examine a low-cost augmented 3D tangible model of a historical site, in which students could interact with historical content through a virtual field trip by using their fingers. Twenty-six 6th grade students participated in a pilot study in order to evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed learning environment called FingerTrips. Participants played with the augmented model in 10 sessions and in groups of 2 or 3 members. Data were collected with an attitude questionnaire and semi-formal group interviews. Students' answers revealed that the FingerTrips environment enhanced their engagement and motivation in history learning, and made them feel as active participants in the historical event presented. Students considered their interactions as a real fieldtrip on the historical landscape model with the help of their fingers. Such an approach is closer to student's interactive experiences and expectations, gamifies learning, and exploits embodied learning affordances, in order to achieve efficient, effective, and enjoyable learning.",

abstract="New forms of technological work assistance can help to handle the increasing amount and availability of information and support the decision-making processes of employees by providing context-sensitive information. When looking at the vision of Augmented Reality especially binocular see-through smart glasses can be useful for this purpose. Therefore, a strong focus should be put on the analysis of information and interaction design as well as its influence on cognitive load and visual comfort when using it in the working environment. Consequently, two systematic reviews are implemented to examine how to ensure the usability of smart devices and which influence factors on human strain exist due to the information and interaction design of smart glasses. The aim of the reviews is to identify the need of further research in the mentioned topics and derive an experimental setup for investigations on binocular see-through smart glasses. Results indicate that the established usability methods and criteria of conventional screen work are still adequate, but they have to be adjusted to the rapid development of new technologies. As potential influence factors on human strain the accommodation-convergence conflict and the positioning of information for primary as well as secondary task instructions are identified. Furthermore, the question arises, if the possibility to individualize the information provision based on users' needs is helpful to support learning effects and optimize mental strain. Therefore a laboratory study will be carried out, which investigate the described effects. The experimental setup of the study is presented in this paper.",

abstract="Integrating ICT technologies in history and geography teaching may promote critical thinking and bridge the gap between unconstructive information accumulation and an explorative and critical learning approach. The aim of this study was to design, deploy and evaluate a low cost and easy-to-use mixed reality learning environment for interdisciplinary and embodied learning of geography, history and computational thinking. The proposed learning environment is comprised of an augmented 3D-tangible model of southern Europe where students interacted using their fingers, and a second treasure hunt augmented interactive floor depicting historical sites, where students performed tasks with Mindstorms EV3 robots. Students swapped between finger-based and robot-based journeys in Europe in two pairs until the end of the game. In order to evaluate our proposal, six groups of four undergraduate participants played with the environment in 6 sessions and for approximately 45 min. Data were collected with a pre and post knowledge test, an attitudes questionnaire and semi-formal group interviews. Students scored significantly higher in the post-tests and their answers in the questionnaires revealed that the multimodal environment enhanced their engagement and motivation, helped them orient themselves better around Europe's geophysical features, while the robotics treasure hunt consolidated their computational thinking skills, inducing a highly entertaining dimension. This approach better conforms to students' interactive experiences and expectations, gamifies learning and exploits embodied learning opportunities. Students engaged in the two augmented spaces in a perceptually immersive experience which became a more authentic and meaningful educational space.",

abstract="Currently, the active development of all industries occurs within the framework of the ``Industry 4.0'' concept. One of the key applications of this concept is the implementation of the Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) and applications that will help to reduce the labor costs and costs of enterprises. Among such applications, undoubtedly, we can highlight Internet of things (IoT) and Augmented Reality (AR). The article discusses the interaction of applications of augmented reality with the Internet of things using the example of visualization of plant data collected by sensors and stored in a cloud service. A laboratory testbed is developed to measure the delay in the delivery of data from the cloud platform to the Augmented Reality application. The mechanism for uploading data to the local cloud is used to optimize the quality parameters. It helps to reduce the delay by introducing a new architecture for implementing IoT/AR applications.",

abstract="In this paper, we present an exploration of two location sensing mechanisms, such as QR codes and beacons, used in Location-based Learning Applications which are performed inside small indoor spaces (e.g. a classroom). The exploration of QR codes was carried out through an implementation of a Location-based Learning Application which was used by students between 7 and 11 years old inside of Primary Schools. Meanwhile, for the exploration of beacons, a functional prototype was made which was systematically tested by students of Faculty of Informatics of UNLP (Argentina). We analysed those characteristics that we have been learned related to how these mechanisms behave when they are used inside small indoor spaces because, in these cases, relevant places to provide learning contents are nearest from each other. We wish to create a discussion about the exploration of these two location sensing mechanisms. We expect that this discussion helps not only to design and develop Location-based Learning Applications, but also to improve authoring tools that are using to generate this kind of applications.",

abstract="Educators have now introduced the so called escape-games into their teaching or training practices. During a limited time, a team of learners collaboratively solves puzzles related to educational content. For learners, the aim consists of ``escaping'' from a room. For educators, an escape-game contextualizes an educational content into a meaningful and inspiring experience based on game-based and collaborative learning. This paper deals with the implementation of what we call educational escape game with the focus on the process dedicated to decontextualize the knowledge after a game session. We want to get a better understanding of debriefing so that practice can improve. The paper is based on an empirical study carried out with teachers/trainers experienced in implementing educational escape games. The paper is organized as follow. We (1) provide with a brief review of literature on debriefing and we argue for the adoption of the term ``institutionalization'', a concept enabling to take into consideration the transformation of knowledge after a game session. We (2) propose a definition for educational escape-game based on a literature review and the systematic analysis of 2 French databases of educational escape games and (3) we discuss the results of an empirical work aiming at understanding how educators carry out the debriefing session which follows the time dedicated to play. According to our theoretical framework, debriefing consists of a process aiming at the transformation of the subjective and situated knowledge developed during the game into objective and transferable knowledge. Interviews and questionnaires conducted with three teachers enable to describe this process in terms of time (chronogenesis), role played by participants (topogenesis) and the settings (objects and relationships between objects) in which this process takes place (mesogenesis). These findings offer the opportunity for new guidelines for the design of debriefing sessions.",

This paper presents i-Wall, an affordable interactive wall system built from off-the-shelf components and technologies. i-Wall has been designed for the Syros Industrial Museum (Greece) and presents a narrative about a particular exhibit, the Enfield E8000, which is the first electric car that reached small-scale production (in 1973). i-Wall provides information to visitors about the concept, the design, the problems, the creators and the socio-political context related to the exhibit, in an interactive way. It also allows visitors to appreciate the interior of the car as well as its functions via augmented reality (AR) technology. The design of i-Wall combines interactive storytelling, animations, projection mapping, conductive paint, touchboard and AR.",

abstract="Today's children spend a lot of time playing digital games, but may be less interested in their schoolwork, especially for subjects they find difficult and are subsequently not willing to spend much time on it, such as mathematics. Serious games can be an effective method to improve the motivation and learning performance of children in math learning. However, current serious games have limitations in classroom applicability. Augmented Reality provides the opportunity for children to immediately visualize the assignment and can be designed to create a fantasy environment that can engage children to delve deeper into the subject. However, it is less well studied how children from different cultures react to the game design of AR learning games. Therefore, in this study, we have designed the base prototype of an AR game, called See Me Roar, aiming to improve children's learning experience. To investigate the effect of our current base game on children's learning motivation compared to the effect of a more traditional paper exercise, two user studies were conducted, one in China and one in an international school in the Netherlands. The results have shown that compared to a traditional paper exercise, the AR game significantly improved a number of motivational correlates, i.e. likability, enjoyment, the desire to do the exercise in free time, recommendation to others, and in general making math more fun. Both Chinese and international children prefer the game over the paper exercise. Insights regarding Self-Determination theory for the development of future versions of the game are subsequently discussed.",

abstract="The way we are experiencing and interacting with our everyday living environment define and anticipate our future behavior and actions. Today new digital technologies vastly diminish boundaries between virtual and physical world. Cross-reality design supported with recent mobile and context aware computing, gradually changed the concept of user interaction and moved it more toward usage of heterogeneous contexts, pervasive computing technologies, and multimodal spatial perception and transformed our living surroundings into smart environments, traditional living object into smart living objects. Ubiquitous computing vision implies more than ever to our lives. In order to make all these changes more human-centered in this paper we are investigated the cognitive and metaphorical aspects of future interface design strategies which could enhance user experience and ideas acceptance, communicated through multimodal interactions. In this paper we are presenting three tangible interfaces that we have developed for design and research purposes and results we collected during their public exposure. Hopefully, the results will give us sufficient insights for further investigations in the field of smart living environments and smart objects development. We believe that to fulfill these goals application and exploration of tangible interfaces frameworks and cognitive methods could be one of the crucial elements for the future research success.",

abstract="Space syntax is an important knowledge domain and focus of study for students of Architecture. It centers on the understanding of spaces, tectonics and volumes for the informed design of buildings or outdoor spaces. Space syntax is considered to be a threshold concept in Architecture, in that understanding and interpreting this knowledge domain is something that the learner needs to acquire in order to progress as a professional in this field. The concept of ``line of sight'' is a specific example of a concept in the space syntax domain. This research investigates a case of systems design of an immersive virtual learning environment to support teaching a concept of space syntax to students of Architecture. Such environments can engage, immerse and guide learners in ways not yet undertaken and may find application in workplace learning. This research explores the systems design requirements through a demonstrator that is tested by a small pilot group. One case scenario to teach the concept of ``line of sight'' was selected for the target design. Based on the expert feedback we designed a learning module demonstrated at the University College London CAVE-hybrid facility. The demonstrator was trialed in 16 timed trials. Several conclusions for workplace learning on the systems design choices are drawn.",

This is due to constant advances in all technology areas and in information technology in particular. New teaching and learning approaches, methods and techniques are introduced into the educational process, applying various technologies like artificial intelligence, computer vision, robotics, etc. And virtual reality is one of those. Virtual laboratories are one of the computer-based learning systems that can help to study various processes (physical, chemical, etc.) simulating and visualizing them on a personal computer without using the actual equipment or reagents. Moreover, with the help of such simulations it is possible to observe the process in detail, from different points or enlarge the image to a convenient size. In this paper an application that helps to study physics in secondary schools is presented. It contains a set of practical problem tasks from a number of physics sections. Each task has visualization scene with virtual reality integrated.

In this framework, modelling people as gaussians, we localise and track people when they step into a defined area. We compared our approach with a typical local minimum one and our algorithm results to be faster and more accurate. Detected leaders manage the interaction with hands. We developed a trained gesture recognition model and a rule-based one and the former approach reports better outcomes. While the proposed virtual environment is mainly intended as a multi-projection system, the presented architecture allows to dynamically change the area such as to integrate further input and output devices. It can be extended up to provide support in collaborative tasks for remotely connected groups acting in the same virtual room. The whole system has been adopted in Cultural Heritage scenarios to provide an immersive experience for art, historical contents or virtual environments. Interviews with people participating to the experimentation phase of the OrCHeSTRA project show that the system was well-received by the general public and that future extensions towards collaborative environments are encouraged by the end-users.",

This is the first step towards a mobile ITS that utilizes eye-tracking and virtual reality glasses, in order to identify difficulties and offer on time feedback in textual or visual mode, which will be superimposed on a transparent lens in users' field of view.

As a solution to this problem, we explore the potential of lightweight containerization techniques for distributed interactive applications. In particular, we present how the necessary runtime and build environments including libraries and drivers can be abstracted using the Docker framework. We demonstrate the packing of an existing single-machine GPU-enabled ray tracer inside a container to be used on tiled display walls. The performance measurements reveal that the containerization has a negligible impact on the system's performance but allows for easy setup, integration, and distribution of complex applications.",

Our proposal also includes development of interactive applications on DTT and IPTV which assumes usability (SIMPLIT) and accessibility (W3C) rules. The authoring tool implementation is also contemplated for the development of interactive applications, under the concept of open existing access repositories templates and an extension of Unity framework for interactive 3D content development without having to program a single code line. Finally, a production methodology of audiovisual content (i-standardized, accessible and usable) in cultural, health, educational and commercial context will also be proposed.",

abstract="Before entering the adult world, typically developing (TD) children tend to learn how to socialize with others in the process of getting along and interacting with their peers at school. However, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulty understanding others' emotions and discerning non-verbal social clues due to their innately impaired social interaction and lack of theory of mind (ToM). Therefore, while socializing with others, children with ASD might not understand the facial expressions or the body movements of others. This causes great difficulty in discerning other people's emotions and recognizing the relationships between themselves and others when interacting with different people in different situations, and as a consequence, to perform the appropriate social reciprocal acts. Therapists or special education teachers usually conduct role-playing strategies to train children with ASD to practice their social reciprocity behavior, after which these children with ASD can practice socializing with others. In reality, however, such a method is generally limited to a single classroom environment and specific situations. For unimaginative children with ASD, such intervention situations and teaching methods are typically limited with low effectiveness. In response, this study adopted mixed-reality (MR) technology to establish a semi-immersive social-interactive situated teaching platform for training emotional representations and non-verbal social cues. The system allows children with ASD to socialize with 3D virtual characters who have different relationships in different virtual situations, enabling them to practice performing the appropriate social reciprocal acts.",

The operational costs of museums increase over the time due to exhibit maintenance and acquisition costs. This cost is inversely proportional to the revenues that can be generated. Virtual reality, avatar technologies, virtual worlds, holograms, gaming and gamification can offer creative interactivity and unique experiences with low or no cost to the global visitor and introduce new revenue streams.

abstract="The key to an effective learning environment is keeping the learner attentive and engaged [51]. The shift towards virtual learning environments, such as online and computer-based learning environments, distance the learner from the instructor and can lead to some less-than-engaging learning experiences. Such environments often lack key attributes necessary to fully engage learners, such as clear goals, adequate feedback, and instructor support. Decades of study in cognitive and educational psychology provide a foundation of knowledge regarding the factors that influence learner engagement, and how we can leverage this knowledge base to create engaging learning experiences in these new technology-driven learning environments. This paper presents a taxonomy that maps ten engagement-inducing learning interventions to learning environments in which they have been found to improve learner engagement, factors that influence learner engagement, and learning gains. Implementation of this taxonomy is then illustrated by presenting a use case implementation within a virtual learning environment, followed by a discussion of important considerations during implementation.",

abstract="This paper explores the general concept of the classroom of the future from a technological perspective, and proposes a set of indicative key facilities that such an environment should incorporate. Over the years, there has been an abundance of related research work aiming to build a ``smarter'' classroom, initially incorporating distance learning, educational games, and intelligent tutoring systems. More recently, many approaches have revolved around the advancements in the domains of Ambient Intelligence and Internet of Things, resulting in the enhancement of the traditional classroom equipment and furniture with processing power and interaction capabilities (e.g. intelligent desk, smart whiteboard) and the integration of emerging solutions in teaching and learning methods (e.g. AR, VR). The proposed intelligent classroom though is a holistic approach towards a student-centric educational ecosystem, which will incorporate state-of-the-art technologies to support (among others) alternative pedagogies, learning through immersive hands-on experiences and collaboration via flexible class layouts. To that end, this paper reports the various ambient facilities of the classroom and the accompanying software, while a prototype of this environment is currently under development in the AmI Facility of FORTH-ICS.",

In special education, wrist-worn wearables have potential to support students in their everyday learning activities. The concrete opportunities in this domain are still unclear though. To explore the potential of wrist-worn applications in special education, we employ user-centered design techniques to elicit the application needs and system requirements. Then, we formally specified, developed and tested an assistive application.

These technologies may be considered communication technologies because they communicate or represent reality. The faith that has been, and can be, communicated is multi-dimensional and consists of sensory information, thoughts, and a variety of emotions. The first-hand study of immersive V.E.'s, although not the ``dominant means of communication'' as the bound book has been for Christianity (Lundby 2013), might be able to reveal that V.E.'s can communicate dimensions of the faith that earlier technologies have been unable to do.",

abstract="Safety education is important in the construction industry, with many onsite injuries and fatalities. Reviewing incident reports can be valuable in preventing the same mistakes from reoccurring and in reinforcing the concept of designing for construction safety. However, the required information can be difficult for students and non-experts to understand in a meaningful way without instructor facilitation. Recently research has shifted into using 3D virtual environments for safety education, with applications teaching learners how to identify hazards and operating procedures. While there are exploratory results on student engagement and overall learning, there is less focus on how the design influences the learning outcomes. For these reasons we conducted a case study in system design to understand how to effectively contextualize raw incident reports into a meaningful 3D educational experience. From our case study, we present a single-learner educational application with both a desktop computer and VR version. The desktop version was used in development of the application's design framework and in a controlled study testing how interaction techniques influence learning and behavioral outcomes. The results showed that interaction technique did significantly affect total time spent using the application, but did not affect remembering and understanding. We discuss how lessons learned from the user study were applied to the VR version, what designs revisions needed to be made, and overall usability. Lastly, we summarize the experiences and evaluations from the case study by listing design guidelines for creating educational virtual environments from existing 2D information records.",

abstract="For a decade now, as mobile devices are found in an ever wider range of learning situations and contexts, mobile learning researchers have sought to define (Sharples, Taylor and Vavoula, 2007; Wexler et al. 2008) and redefine (Crompton, 2013) mobile learning in a way that is meaningful within this increasing range. However, the need to assimilate this ever increasing range of situations and contexts has become a progressively more complex challenge which is well illustrated by Park's (2011) paper that aims to categorise educational applications of mobile technologies into four types. Like many others Park includes the classroom as a pedagogical context for mobile learning. However, Sharples et al. (2007)'s original definition emphasised the assumption that, for learning to be mobile, learners are continually on the move which is clearly not the case for students using mobile devices in class to, say, record audio or video or as a classroom voting system. Yet we continue to try to assimilate these instances into our understanding of mobile learning. Is it not now time to accommodate this complexity and create a new concept reserving the original term `mobile learning' for mobile technology supported learning opportunities that involve the learners physically moving between contexts? This paper will therefore engage its audience in a debate about whether it is time to rethink definitions of mobile learning to exclude static, classroom based learning opportunities using tablets such as iPads or students' own mobile devices. Such learning opportunities would need renaming, maybe `handheld learning' or `hand-e-learning'? Though that begs the question, is this not just another form of e-learning making a separate name unnecessary? Other suggestions will be invited on the day so as to involve both experienced and new researchers in this debate.",

abstract="The paradigm of museum as ``a place without borders'' meets new possibilities in the age of globalization and digital media. The highly technological driven audiences present a continuous challenge for most Museums to attract and engaged. The focus is now mainly on the experience -- the Museum experience, that can also be modeled and enhanced by the use of digital media. This article presents a preliminary view on the presence of digital media in two identified Water Museums: two case studies from the Global Network of Water Museums (WAMUT-NET, an initiative of UNESCO). We've identified the presence of similar digital technologies and tools, but different forms of integrating them in each Museum's scale, context and mission. Further research should follow, to identify in situ, and in articulation with curators and visitors, new findings.",

In the classroom, educators know how to motivate their students and how to exploit this knowledge to optimize their teaching when a student shows demotivation signs. In eLearning environments it is much more difficult to evaluate student motivation level. The study identified 19 research papers in teaching and learning programming using eLearning. The papers are derived from a number of digital databases which were published in the last two decades. This study found that a majority of the research in eLearning focuses on student knowledge and skills in programming. To motivate the student, visualization, simulation, animation and game-based approaches have been used in the learning process. These approaches focus on making the interaction attractive rather than identifying and diagnosing student motivation state in the eLearning systems.

The models are considered important devices to learn and transmit thoughts about architecture and the landscape, even within museum institutions. Their historical importance for representing urban spaces and the territory is also analysed. In recent years, physical models have taken on original value thanks to the implementation of new technologies. These technologies not only expand the models' functions, but also promote a use that renews and updates the relationship between object and user, increasing the participatory aspect.",

This work presents an approach for the usage of bare hands to control an immersive game from an egocentric perspective and built from a proposed case study methodology. We used a DenseNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to perform the recognition in real-time, from both indoor and outdoor environments, not requiring any image segmentation process. Our research also generated a vocabulary, considering users' preferences, seeking a set of natural and comfortable hand poses and evaluated users' satisfaction and performance for an entertainment setup. Our recognition model achieved an accuracy of 97.89{\%}. The user's studies show that our method outperforms the classical controllers in regards to natural interactions.

abstract="Gestural interfaces are closely related with cognition and physical activity, and can be powerful tools for cognitive training and motor skills. Their use has been proposed by researchers in various areas, including education, and within this field, inclusive education. In this study, a systematic literature review about children computer gestural interactions (touch, body, face and motion) and on its application to digital educational resources for learning disabilities has been conducted. Applying the Torres-Carri{\'o}n method, a ``conceptual mindfact'' and research problem has been structured, as a basis to build the search script, to be applied in the selected scientific databases (Scopus, WoS and Google Scholar). Five research questions are proposed, which involves standards of gesture-based computer interaction for children, design guides, methods and instruments, non-invasive interaction environments and personalization of didactic resources for children with special needs, in particular children with Down' syndrome. As a final product, a list of relevant magazines and databases of the area has been obtained; 47 valid papers were analyzed to answer the research questions, and they are organized in a structured way, allowing the researcher to establish a valid context from which to focus future research.",

A large number of schools actively carry out virtual experimental teaching and establish virtual laboratories. As a kind of immersive interactive technology, virtual reality technology is attracting increasing attention in education. This paper describes the characteristics of immersive VR, hardware and software types, summarizes the different forms of VR used in teaching and discusses the principles of biological virtual experiment construction in other research. Taking the teaching content of `structure of eyeball' in middle school biology textbook as a case, this research designs and develops a virtual experiment courseware - Miraculous eyeball.

The scene scheduling in the audio-visual language of animation includes action design, the design of characters' moving routes in space, and the arrangement and design between the roles and the background. Traditional teaching methods are not enough to provide virtual scenes for learners to practice. Therefore, this paper develops an immersive gamification teaching environment for the practical teaching of scene scheduling content in audio-visual animation language, which includes three aspects: role scene scheduling, shot scene scheduling, role scheduling and shot scheduling. Given this teaching system we have carried on the teaching pilot experiment, the experimental results showed that the immersive teaching environment could improve students' learning effect, promote the construction of action program schemata, and promote the formation and maintenance of skills.",

abstract="One of the main benefits of educational robotics is its potential to inspire curiosity and creativity in students. Creativity in educational robotics has been typically associated with the constructionist learning paradigm and the processes of building, programming and manipulating task-centric robotic platforms. On the other hand, there has been a growing tendency recently to use anthropomorphic social robots in education that act not only as tools but also as peers and teaching assistants. Since the role of anthropomorphic social robots is to engage as social actors, designing and manipulating robots as a form of creation is no longer a goal for educational robotics. This paper argues that a new form of creativity concerns the meanings students make of anthropomorphic robots in the course of human-robot social interaction. This is based on the following assumptions: creativity is socially constructed and the main reason for students to be interested in robotics is a fascination with the illusion of life. In particular, this paper proposes to encourage the ability to create meanings through exploration of a mismatch between humanlike robot design and the human frame of reference.",

Representation of 3D content covering temporal properties can be useful in application domains that benefit from analysis of users' and objects' behavior, such as education, training, e-commerce, marketing and merchandising. However, the available approaches do not enable exploration of 3D content with regards to its time-dependent properties. The main contribution of this paper is temporal representation of interaction. The representation is based on semantic web standards and ontologies, which enable use of general as well as domain knowledge for exploration of content. The representation is discussed in the context of an immersive virtual car showroom implemented using headsets and motion tracking devices.",

Furthermore, based on a mathematical approach grounded in the utility theory and stochastic approximation the researchers develop a quantitative model. This model presents a utility function that reflects the teachers' preferences for employing ICT tools and their impact on two of teaching approaches -- passive and active. The derived utility functions help to reveal the sub-optimal proportions of the considered technological resources in the classroom education.

abstract="In many everyday purchase decisions, consumers have to trade-off their decisions between alternatives. For example, consumers often have to decide whether to buy the more expensive high quality product or the less expensive product of lower quality. Marketing researchers are especially interested in finding out how consumers make decisions when facing such trade-off conflicts and eye-tracking has been used as a tool to investigate the allocation of attention in such situations. Conflicting decision situations are also particularly interesting for human-computer interaction research because designers may use knowledge about the information acquisition behavior to build assistance systems which can help the user to solve the trade-off conflict. In this paper, we build and test such an assistance system that monitors the user's information acquisition processes using mobile eye-tracking in the virtual reality. In particular, we test whether and how strongly the trade-off conflict influences how consumers direct their attention to products and features. We find that trade-off conflict, task experience and task involvement significantly influence how much attention products receive. We discuss how this knowledge might be used in the future to build assistance systems in the form of attentive smart glasses.",

During the master-class the main goal is not to teach how to use the technology perfectly but to show its advantages, persuade to use a particular technology, demonstrate the ease of use, and motivate teachers for the further use of the offered technologies in their professional activity.

abstract="Virtual reality (VR) applications become increasingly popular in various application domains because of the possibilities of realistic immersive presentation and interaction with virtual objects as well as the diversity of advanced, relatively cheap devices. The semantic web, which is an important trend in the current web development, requires effective exploration of content distributed across different applications. Exploration of 3D content, which is the main part of VR applications, is a complex task, as the geometry, structure and appearance of the content may interactively evolve over time. Although a number of solutions are available for implementation of VR applications, the approaches have not been intended for on-demand exploration of behavior-rich 3D content in real time. In this paper, we present the development pipeline of explorable VR applications, which is based on semantic composition of 3D content activities into more complex behavior. The resulting applications are based on Prolog, which is a well-established knowledge representation language, and they can be queried for time-dependent 3D content features using domain-specific concepts. The approach has been implemented using the OpenStage 2 motion capture system and the Unity game engine. It can be used in different application domains and improve the integration of VR with the semantic web.",

The goal of this study was to explain and analyse the main characteristics and learning strategies of these two MOOC (strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for improvement). The results show that although strategies vary depending on the subjects, the contents and exercises should be practical and adapted to students (interests, level, time availability and aesthetics), always considering motivation as a key point (gamification). These topics have been found to have a considerable influence on the success of a MOOC. Therefore, the conclusions should be considered in subsequent versions of these courses and other MOOCs.",

Adaptive instruction is sometimes referred to as differentiated instruction and is any learning experience tailored to meet the needs and preferences of an individual learner or team. An intelligent tutoring system (ITS) is the technology which delivers adaptive instruction. Adaptive instructional systems (AISs) use human variability and other learner/team attributes along with instructional conditions to develop/select appropriate strategies (domain-independent policies) and tactics (actions). The goal of adaptive instruction is to optimize learning, performance, retention, and the transfer of skills between the training environment and the work or operational environment where the skills learned during training are to be applied.",

abstract="Social computing constitutes a new computing paradigm in an interdisciplinary research community which will strongly influence informatics systems and applications in the years to come. Indeed, from a social perspective, considerable interest in examining the influences of Social Computing (SC) for Social Inclusion (SI) arises from researchers and designers. This paper addresses the existing literature on the use of SC for SI. Previous studies have been reviewed to report affordances of SC design in five different areas: (a) for the elderly, (b) for people with disabilities, (c) for gender studies, (d) for societal change, and (e) for the preservation of cultural heritage. Results from the literature overview provide some examples of applications of new technologies that were designed to reduce social exclusion. Our review further shows that the use of different tools used by different groups of people has a positive impact for those people who are either socially included or excluded from their use. However, further research is needed in these five directions, which are analysed in this document and direct research into the gaps identified.",

This paper discusses a five-phase teaching process to assist in training the fundamentals of research. The five phases are: 1. Identification of research questions and background research. 2. The development of research protocols and their associated training, 3. The selection and understanding of appropriate assessment techniques, 4. The coordination and execution of data collection, and 5. Statistical analysis and reporting. This process uses an existing research experiment at ARL focusing on the impact of different types of display surfaces to support military tactical decision-making to serve as a case study.

This paper describes the results of a survey where drivers in the use of media show continuously increasing or decreasing values from the first to the fourth year of study experience at the Western University, Canada, highlighting trends in the usage of new and traditional media in higher education by students. The survey was used to gather data on students' media usage habits and user satisfaction from first to fourth year of study and found that media usage increases over the years from first to fourth. The presentation of data using bar charts reveals a slight increase over the years in students owning notebooks or laptops off-campus and a significant increase from first to fourth year of students accessing online academic periodicals and journals. Another noteworthy finding relates to fourth year students being more conscious of the quality of information that they read on the Internet in comparison to students in first year, even though this is a slight year on year increase.",

Technology is disrupting virtually every aspect of life and work, from 3D printing, cloud computing and advanced robotics to biotechnology and human genomics. This is a dramatic change, and it calls for a more flexible and agile workforce, able to move between various disciplines and industry sectors. This paper attempts to address three key interrelated questions. How can we prepare students for a future that is impossible to predict? How can the learning environment enable this change to take place? And, what are the role for the lecturers? Last year NEF: The Innovation Institute did a piece of policy work called Inventing the Future: transforming STEM economies---this included think-tank meetings and surveys (Inventing the Future: Transforming STEM Economies 2014). More than 100 leading STEM-based organisations were interviewed about their current and future skills requirements. In our survey, a mere 16 {\%} of companies said that their skills needs were being fully met. At the other end of the spectrum, 32 {\%} said that finding people with the right skills was a serious struggle. This is the current situation; but what about if we look forward ten, five or just two years? What kind of competencies will students need then? The answers are eye opening.",

abstract="Technologically-enhanced physical environments are gradually replacing a natural part of our working and living environments. Although their use in everyday life is still rare, there has been a good effort towards a better understanding of their implications in our society, and the type of user experiences that can be provided. In this paper, we discuss various issues related to user-centric designs of technologically-enhanced environments based on our results and previous literature. We ground our argument on the hypotheses that these environments are becoming an indispensable part of people's daily lives. The integration of technologically-enhanced environments into the fabric of everyday life requires, therefore, to take into consideration a set of human experience dimensions (e.g. emotional, instrumental value, etc.) when shaping the interaction between people and the environment they live and act in. Understanding people expectations, the experience they seek in technologically-enhanced environments, and enabling them to easily influence and shape their self-crafted environments according to their needs and ever-changing expectations, in a trustworthy and controllable, can help us shape a more acceptable and meaningful vision of technologically-enhanced environments for all those living and acting in them.",

That is comprehensible from a technical point of view due to every research field needs to implement their own characteristics. A previous literature review was carried out [1] aiming to find definitions, methodologies to build PG, and software metrics for them. But considering that a definition was not found based on the player experience, we decided to delve into this topic. In this paper, we present a summary of definitions of PG presented by several researchers in order to check and collect their particularities.

In this paper, we therefore propose an extensive modeling language for MLGs. This model was designed, with the help of botanical experts, in order to cover the variety of MLG types they would like for their field trips. This modeling language uses high-level concepts, such as game activities and points of interest on a map that can therefore be used by teachers in any domain. Finally, we discuss how scenarios, described with this language, can be automatically transformed into executable web applications.",

abstract="The world population is rapidly aging and becoming a burden to health systems around the world. In this work we present a conceptual framework to encourage the research community to develop more comprehensive and adaptive ICT solutions for prevention and rehabilitation of chronic conditions in the daily life of the aging population and beyond health facilities. We first present an overview of current international standards in human functioning and disability, and how chronic conditions are interconnected in older age. We then describe innovative mobile and sensor technologies, predictive data analysis in healthcare, and game-based prevention and rehabilitation techniques. We then set forth a multidisciplinary approach for the personalized prevention and rehabilitation of chronic conditions using unobtrusive and pervasive sensors, interactive activities, and predictive analytics, which also eases the tasks of health-related researchers, caregivers and providers. Our proposal represents a conceptual basis for future research, in which much remains to be done in terms of standardization of technologies and health terminology, as well as data protection and privacy legislation.",

The museum building now occupies the same space where the curing yard was over 100 years prior, hence the deployment of a virtual reconstruction of the curing yard in a game engine enables the museum visitors to explore the virtual world from equivalent vantage points in the real world. The project methodology achieves the goal of maximising user experience for visitors while minimising cost for the museum, and focus group evaluations of the system revealed the success of the interaction-free design with snackable content. A major implication of the findings is that museums can provide compelling and informative experiences that enable visitors to travel back in time with minimal interaction and relatively low cost systems.",

abstract="Background: The objective of Industry 4.0 is to bring into existence smart, self-regulating and interconnected industrial value creation through the integration of cyber-physical systems into manufacturing. Industry 4.0 is a new paradigm of production and one that leads to a faster and more precise decision-making, entirely new approach to production, work organization manner of work task performance, which may have a significant influence on the health and safety of workers. Objectives: To provide an overview of potential effects (positive and negative) of Industry 4.0 on occupational health and safety and to list some of the recommendations regarding the integration of OHS into manufacturing in the Industry 4.0 context. Methods: A critical review of the literature currently available on this topic. Results: There are many risks as well as opportunities for occupational health and safety that derive from Industry 4.0. A considerable challenge, especially in the transitional period, is posed by insufficiency of initiatives with respect to occupational health and safety including standards and regulations, which may render them incommensurate in the face of newer and newer threats as Industry 4.0 technologies emerge. Furthermore, it may lead to forfeiting the proactive approach towards occupational health and safety that has been established in the most industrialized countries. Further research is required to enhance integration of occupational health and safety into manufacturing in the context of Industry 4.0. To achieve this, an interdisciplinary approach needs to be adopted drawing on the expertise of a team comprising engineers, IT experts, psychologists, ergonomists, social and occupational scientists, medical practitioners, and designers. The overview was carried by the research group IDEAT.",

Therefore, it is vital to provide stores with a better solution which could integrate an advanced product displaying method with object tracking and recognition and user behaviour interaction approaches. The designed solution proposes an interactive show-window, which emphasizes customized product visualization and direct interactivity to reinforce the connection, during physical shopping, between goods and consumers. We explore the possible feedback when people interact with the interactive show-window using a qualitative study, which has also been facilitated through an interactive show-window installation.

pages="475--492",
abstract="The dental health of children with autism presents many challenges, since they usually perceive sensory experiences differently and have problems accepting unknown social contexts. In a dental care setting, there are many strong sound-visual stimulations that are not experienced in any other setting. This usually upsets a patient with autism, often forcing dentists to administer chemical sedation in order to carry out dental work. Recently, many technology-enhanced systems and apps have been proposed to help people with autism adapt and cope with distressing situations. However, few studies have attempted to exploit ICT to simplify dental care in people with autism. This study explores the potential of personalized digital tools to help children with autism become familiar with dental care procedures and environments and to learn how to perform proper oral hygiene at home. To this aim, we carried out a 3-month exploratory study involving a multidisciplinary team of researchers, developers, dentists, psychologist, parents and ten children with autism observed under natural conditions during their first dental care cycle. The results appear to confirm the potential of technology for reducing anxiety in professional settings, increasing children's wellbeing and safety. The main contribution of this paper is the detailed account of this exploratory study and the discussion of the results obtained. Moreover, we outline the user requirements of an accessible and customizable multimodal platform to help dentists and families facilitate ADS children's dental care according to the methodology described here.",

abstract="A learning disability (LD) is a problem affecting how a student cognitively receives and processes information. Students with this condition may have trouble with learning skills including reading, writing and calculation. Therefore, it might be pedagogically inappropriate to adopt typical approaches with other students to teach LD students. This paper examines various approaches to teaching mathematics among LD students, covering both non-technological and technological. It points to the importance to integrate both approaches to make learning of mathematics among LD learners more effective. It is believed that technological tools are more engaging to students who have a short span of learning attention and those who need more aids for visualisation to learn. However, these have to be utilised appropriately based on the principles proposed by the non-technological approaches such as CPA, 3R and Task Analysis.",

abstract="Motion sensing games are operated with body movements that are captured dynamically by somatosensory devices so that more authentic experiences can be gained for users compared with the traditional operations with keyboards or joysticks. The motion sensing game design involving interactive design, user cognition, information layout of product, interface, influences nearly every important aspect of user experience. To our knowledge, the main problems exist in the motion sensing game design are as follows: (1) motion sensing games, as new type of video games, lack guiding theories and methods for reference. (2) To enhance user experiences for players, it is necessary to increase the research on user perception of user l behaviors in early stages of the design. Therefore, inefficiency of game design arises due to lack of effective research methods. In addition, (3) it takes a very long time to develop the project and it also costs a lot. Only by determine users' needs in early stages can these problems be resolved. Inspired by current user research methods within human-computer interaction, product design, and architecture, this paper argue that a persona that is created as a design tool can be used in the process of motion sensing game design. This paper ground the persona method through a design project, Ball Game, based on Kinect. This approach opens new avenues for the analysis and practice of user-centered interaction design of motion sensing games and improves the game experience significantly.",

The MPV is continuous and non-redundant, it shows the near part of the scene with a conventional, first-person visualization to anchor the user, and it is controlled with user head translations and rotations reminiscent of natural motion. Three types of anchored MPV are introduced, one that provides a lateral disocclusion effect, allowing the user to see around occluders and through side portals, one that provides a vertical disocclusion effect, allowing the user to see over and on top of occluders, and one that provides teleportation, allowing the user to relocate. The VR navigation efficiency benefits of the anchored MPV have been analyzed in a user study. Significant improvements were achieved in the metrics of number of teleportations and total distance traveled. In these metrics, large or greater Cohen's d effect sizes were observed at p-values below 0.05 in a first VR scene, while medium effect sizes at p-values of 0.1 or better were observed in a second VR scene.",

abstract="Architectural Visualizations are the evolution from a once used technique of Architectural Rendering. Through the proliferation of modern technology, the industry has progressed by using more contemporary applications to produce three dimensional (3D) renders for the output of images and videos. Using such applications allows for ``photo-realistic'' visuals that have an uncanny representation to a real-life environment, for clients to visualize proposed buildings, which can offer both interior and exterior environments. However, such applications lack a key component that could extend the platform that the visualization industry currently uses. Through recent technological developments pertaining to game engines, virtual game environments can render high fidelity visuals in real-time whilst providing interactive elements for deployment to various devices. This paper aims to create and implement an alternative method to the conventional three-dimensional pre-rendered visualizations, using a 3D game engine that can provide an interactive based solution, distributed to a computer device, for both the industry and the end user to experience.",

Big Data is trending due to few of the main reasons such as cloud migration initiated by companies, aggregation of digital unstructured and machine data, strong administration of data security permission, and many others. As we all know, analytics is the process of drawing conclusions and finding insights from a big pile. Big Data analytics is defined as the process of querying, simplifying, obtaining insights from the huge set of data integrated in the file systems of Big Data framework. The insights obtained as the outcome of analytics should reach the end users operating on the application platform in the form of visual representation techniques such as reports, line graphs, and bar charts for better understanding and exploration about the data. We propose a case study consisting of comparison of all the existing data visualization tools and techniques available and suitable with Big Data. The paper outlines all the advantages and disadvantages of Data Visualization tools and recommends to use the one which outclasses the comparison test. The later part of paper explains about the methodology proposed using Big Data Hadoop and CDH's Apache Impala, Hue, and Hive.

abstract="The active involvement of teenagers in the design of interactive technologies for museums is lacking further development. Adopting a user-driven innovation framework along with cooperative inquiry, we report and discuss a case study that has been designed to involve users in the ideation of interpretive experiences for a local museum. Working in collaboration with the Natural History Museum of Funchal, this contribution will present and discuss co-design sessions that were aimed at participants with ages 15 to 17 and where they were asked to ideate an interactive museum experience. As a result of the co-design sessions, we have found several design patterns. We have grouped these patterns into four categories that express the interests of a teenage audience; these categories are: ``interactions'', ``gaming'', ``localization'' and ``social media''. Our findings suggest that teenagers value interactive technologies when visiting museums and that user-driven innovation plays an important role when involving this specific audience in the design of user experiences for museums.",

abstract="Robots are gradually but steadily being introduced in our daily lives. A paramount application is that of education, where robots can assume the role of a tutor, a peer or simply a tool to help learners in a specific knowledge domain. Such endeavor posits specific challenges: affective social behavior, proper modelling of the learner's progress, discrimination of the learner's utterances, expressions and mental states, which, in turn, require an integrated architecture combining perception, cognition and action. In this paper we present an attempt to improve the current state of robots in the educational domain by introducing the EASEL EU project. Specifically, we introduce the EASEL's unified robot architecture, an innovative Synthetic Tutor Assistant (STA) whose goal is to interactively guide learners in a science-based learning paradigm, allowing us to achieve such rich multimodal interactions.",

Taking input from current industry-level procedures, the training consists in guided step-by-step operations in order to teach the operators how to assemble, disassemble and maintain a certain machine. In our system the interaction is performed in a natural way: the user can see his own real hands, by means of a 3D camera placed on the HMD, and use them to grab and move the machine pieces in order to perform the training task. We believe that seeing your own hands during manipulative tasks present fundamental advantages over mediated techniques. In this paper we describe the system architecture and present our strategy as well as the results of a pilot test aiming at a preliminary evaluation of the system.",

The digital dollhouse provides immersive space for children, which develops their communication skills through their imaginary play through the complement of CG for enhancing the understanding of their situation. In this paper we present details of this prototype digital dollhouse. We also categorize requirements for digital play therapy, which are given by psychological viewpoints based on the prototype. Interdisciplinary design processes collaborating with engineers and psychologists show the possibility that digital dollhouses will be used for enhancing the communication, and providing the variety of training program that was difficult to prepare compared with the existent normal therapy devices.",

The challenge of teaching the emerging technologies to school students was addressed through collaboration of engineering educators from Technion and MIT and professional engineers from PTC Corp. The participants were 15 high school students majoring in computer science. The program included three parts studied at the Technion. In the robotics course, the students constructed and programmed mobile robotic arms to pick and place objects of unknown weight and communicate via the IoT platform ThingWorx. In the second course, the school students programmed a TurtleBot Waffle robot equipped by LIDAR sensor to navigate in an environment by means of simultaneous localization and mapping. In the mini project the students programmed two mobile robotic arms and the Waffle to implement a warehouse scenario, in which the robots jointly carried out loading, transportation and warehousing of a cargo. Assessment results indicated that the students acquired initial understanding of the studied concepts. The program raised their interest in intelligent robotics and awareness about technological and social changes associated with Industry 4.0.",

On the other hand, immersive virtual reality (VR) has been shown to afford greater spatial understanding. In this paper, we present the Geometry Explorer, a VR system designed to facilitate geometry education by leveraging increased spatial understanding. The system uses a Samsung Gear VR to allow users to view and manipulate the dimensions of 3D shapes. We have created a game based on the goal of manipulating shapes to reach target volumes. We informally evaluated our initial prototype using the Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation (RITE) approach. In this paper, we present our modifications based on the usability issues discovered during RITE testing. We conclude by discussing the future of the Geometry Explorer.",

Can an emotional cognitive architecture injected into an artifact make it more ``humane'', and therefore, more productive in a variety of creative collaboration paradigms? Here, we argue that the answer is positive. A large number of research projects in the field of digital art that are currently underway could benefit from integration of an emotional architecture component into them. An example is the project Robodanza (a robotic dancer), the functioning of which is based on a hidden Markov model trained by a genetic algorithm, yet lacking deep emotional intelligence. Generalizing on this example, we outline a roadmap to building a variety of useful virtual creative assistants to humans based on an emotionally intelligent cognitive architecture. ",

abstract="Persuasive technologies for physical rehabilitation have been proposed in a number of different health interventions such as post-stroke gait rehabilitation. We propose a new persuasive system, called Augmented Crutches, aimed at helping people to walk with crutches. People with injuries, or with any sort of mobility problem typically use assistive devices such as crutches, walkers or canes in order to be able to walk more independently. However, walking with crutches is a learning skill that needs continuous repetition and constant attention to detail in order to walk correctly with them and without suffering negative consequences, such as falls or injuries. In close collaboration with therapists, we identify the main issues that patients face when walking with crutches. These vary from person to person, but the most common and hardest challenges are the position and coordination of the crutches. Augmented Crutches studies human behavior aspects in these situations and augments the ground space around the user with digital visual cues where timing is the most important factor, without the need for a constant therapist providing manual help. This is performed through a mini-projector connected to a smartphone, worn by the user in a portable, lightweight manner. Our system helps people to learn how to walk using crutches with increased self-confidence and motivation. Additionally, our work identifies timing, controllability and awareness as the key design dimensions for the successful creation of persuasive, interactive experiences for learning how to walk with crutches.",

Despite this achievement, it is also an important technological innovation to ensure the wellbeing of this new generation. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technological revolution that aims to connect electronic devices used daily through the internet. This occurs thanks to advances and innovation in smart spaces such as wireless sensors, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and information security. Technology can be a key ally to Home Care, by generating solutions for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). AAL combined with the IoT is a promising solution for the elderly public, promoting more autonomy, security, and quality of life. However, the design of technological solutions that consider the opinion and needs of the elderly is still a problem to be researched. Given this context, this article presents a systematic study of publications from 5 scientific databases. The aim is to identify the participatory methods used in the design of IoT solutions for elderly Home Care, as well as how Personas and Semiotics methods were used in this context. The results include a consistent analysis that aims to assist designers, researchers, and developers in future solutions for Home Care and AAL for elderly people.",

abstract="Collaborative virtual reality (VR), such as room-based or CAVE-type systems, has demonstrated benefits in engaging teams in the shared design exploration. Though much research explores how virtual reality may be affecting and contributing to the quality of the team discussion for making design decisions, evidence of how this technology becomes used and adopted in practical settings remains limited. Studies from other engineering and manufacture domains consistently report on practical, behavioral and organizational challenges and more often, resistance to introducing innovative technologies and processes. This study examines how technology adopters experience virtual reality, and explores the factors determining the extent of its implementation as an innovative practice. Drawing on the concept of technological frames, we examine how collaborative VR may introduce a non-trivial process change in an organization before it can potentially become an everyday practice. A large portable VR display system was set up in the central office of a large infrastructure project over a period of one year. During the latter half of a second study we did not observe the extensive uptake and use that we and the technology sponsors within the project anticipated. To understand the reasons, we use three technological frames that allows us to examine the technology adoption and organizational change: (i) nature of technology, to understand users' view of the technology; (ii) technology strategy, to understand users' role-based views of the motivations and incentives for technology adoption within an organization, and (iii) technology in use, to understand how intended users view the technology use on a daily basis.",

abstract="This paper examines the components, functions, and interactions of adaptive instructional systems (AISs) as a method to construct a conceptual model for use in the development of IEEE standards. AISs are artificially-intelligent, computer-based systems that guide learning experiences by tailoring instruction and recommendations based on the goals, needs, and preferences of each individual learner or team in the context of domain learning objectives. IEEE is exploring standards and best practices for AIS modeling, interoperability, and evaluation under its Project 2247 and affiliated working group. This paper was composed to document the interaction of learners with AISs in the context of a domain of instruction. The goal is to identify key interactions within AISs that drive instructional decisions, and to identify the data and methods required to support those machine-based instructions. In other words, we seek to identify methods to assess learner/team progress toward instructional objectives (e.g., knowledge, acquisition, skill development, performance, retention, and transfer of skills from instruction to operational/working environments. As part of the examination of AIS elements, we review a set of popular AIS architectures as a method of identifying what makes AISs unique from other instructional technologies. We conclude with recommendations for future AIS research and standards development.",

All these is enabled by the static LOG file, providing a time record of all steps, executed during measurements. We present the detailed case study of remote laboratory ``Transient phenomena in electric oscillations'' with about 170 university students of bachelor studies. We discovered the ``knowledge barrier'' at the beginning of process of measurements, leading to the excessive time losses and discovering the sources of it in simple mathematical relation of formula---graph and inability to evaluate data accordingly. We also found the ill effect of this inability on the total time of laboratory exercise. As a solution we suggest the use of components of virtual and augmented reality and artificial intelligence for reasonable influence of students' activities and advice together with cooperating experienced teacher.",

abstract="Room-scale virtual reality (VR) holds great potential as a medium for communication and collaboration in remote and same-time, same-place settings. Related work has established that movement realism can create a strong sense of social presence, even in the absence of photorealism. Here, we explore the noteworthy attributes of communicative interaction using embodied minimal avatars in room-scale VR in the same-time, same-place setting. Our system is the first in the research community to enable this kind of interaction, as far as we are aware. We carried out an experiment in which pairs of users performed two activities in contrasting variants: VR vs. face-to-face (F2F), and 2D vs. 3D. Objective and subjective measures were used to compare these, including motion analysis, electrodermal activity, questionnaires, retrospective think-aloud protocol, and interviews. On the whole, participants communicated effectively in VR to complete their tasks, and reported a strong sense of social presence. The system's high fidelity capture and display of movement seems to have been a key factor in supporting this. Our results confirm some expected shortcomings of VR compared to F2F, but also some non-obvious advantages. The limited anthropomorphic properties of the avatars presented some difficulties, but the impact of these varied widely between the activities. In the 2D vs. 3D comparison, the basic affordance of freehand drawing in 3D was new to most participants, resulting in novel observations and open questions. We also present methodological observations across all conditions concerning the measures that did and did not reveal differences between conditions, including unanticipated properties of the think-aloud protocol applied to VR.",

Therefore, our interface exploits the three-dimensional topology of physical sand, which is distributed over a tabletop surface. We discovered, that users of the system were engaged by the natural interaction and playful manner of the installation, as it resembles the play in a sandbox. We demonstrate an artistic setup that produces ambient soundscapes using a Lattice Boltzmann based particle simulation running through a deformable landscape. Visual feedback is front-projected onto the sand as well as the user's hand. The user can explore and change the landscape by using his or her hands and use spatial gestures via on-body projection to control AR content and further settings. The focus of this work lies on the simultaneous interaction with sand and the user's own body, and it's contribution to audio-visual installations.",

abstract="Synthesizing three-dimensional objects from single or multiple two-dimensional views has been a challenging task. To combat this, several techniques involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have been proposed. Since its advent in 2014, there has been a tremendous amount of research done in the area of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Among the various applications of GANs, image synthesis has shown great potential due to the power of two deep neural networks---generator and discriminator, trained in a competitive way, which are able to produce reasonably realistic images. Formulation of 3D-GANs---which are able to generate three-dimensional objects from multiple two-dimensional views with impressive accuracy---has emerged as a promising solution to the aforementioned issue. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of deep learning methods used in generating three-dimensional objects, reviews the different models and frameworks for three-dimensional object generation, and discusses some evaluation metrics and future research direction in using GANs as an alternative for simultaneous localization and environment mapping as well as leveraging the power of GANs to revolutionize the field of education and medicine.",

The considerations presented in this work are based on the design and development of some applications to physics subjects, however they can also be useful for application projects from other subjects.",

abstract="Contrary to popular belief, social influence encompasses a much more complex area of behavioral science than the explanation offered by those who call all forms of social influence a social norm, peer pressure, or simply social proof. To help scholars and practitioners develop a deeper understanding of social influence, this study presents a measurement instrument for evaluating susceptibility to seven social influence principles, namely social learning, social comparison, social norms, social facilitation, social cooperation, social competition, and social recognition. Each principle is represented by a construct containing six theory-driven items, both positively and negatively framed. Further, the study introduces a social influence research model that describes how the seven social influence constructs are correlated and impact each other. This study extends previous scientific work on social influence by providing research tools that can be used to further study the role of social influence in designing tailored technologies for transformation.",

Aiming to improve it's usability, it is necessary to evaluate the interfaces using scientific evaluation methods, like questionnaires. Often the results of these evaluations are different when performed by different interface designers, indicating lack of sistematicity of evaluation results. Questionnaires can be automated to support usability evaluation, facilitating the collection and summarization of data. This paper analyzes the automating possibility of a standardized usability questionnaire for further automation. A bibliographical research was carried out about Human-Computer Interaction concepts, usability, usability evaluation methods (including questionnaires) and automation. A systematic review was conducted to identify automated usability questionnaires. The Post-Study Systems Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) was chosen to be automated because it is small, free and highly reliable. Analysis of the users and specification of the system requirements and architecture were made.",

Digital games form the most dynamic area of mediatization and a strong market outperforming by the rate of growth any other media business. Digital games attract players of all ages. In response, game-based learning is flourishing. But also textbook publishers have reasons to be reluctant. Although there is a trend toward digital textbooks, playfulness is rare. Textbook gamification is a novel approach to overcome this deficiency. It is pragmatic and efficient, because it builds upon the existing digital material of available textbooks. Particular game categories prove to be effective for the transformation of learning material into a playful form. Webble technology provides the matching IT concepts for gamification.

abstract="Augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and virtual reality (VR) technologies -- collectively extended reality (XR) -- have been discussed in the context of training applications since their introduction to the market. While this discussion was initially founded on potential benefit, the rapid pace and advancements within the XR industry allow the technology to fulfill initial expectations in terms of training utility. As XR becomes an effective training tool, two open areas of research, among many, include integrating experiences between VR and AR/MR simulations, as XR training often obscures the trainer from the trainee's environment, and determining the optimal level of fidelity and overall usability of interaction within XR simulations for the training of fine- and gross-motor control tasks, as new peripherals and technologies enter the market supporting a variety of interaction fidelities, such as data glove controllers, skeletal motion capture suits, tracking systems, and haptic devices. XR may show more promise as a training platform the closer it can replicate real world and naturalistic training interactions and immersion. This paper discusses efforts in these two research areas, including a planned usability study on the impact of the fidelity of interactions on training of fine- and gross-motor control tasks in virtual environments.",

Telling children stories helps them to understand the world, to learn about their culture, to vehiculate specific concepts, to reflect upon experiences. In an educational context, storytelling facilitates literacy, building shared meanings between adults and children. In recent years, thanks to technological development, digital tools have been included in the storytelling process, giving life to digital storytelling. A relevant feature of storytelling, both traditional and digital, is the chance to put together the cognitive dimension with the emotional one. For this reason it has been employed to gather attention from people with profound intellectual and mental disabilities too. The emotional dimension can be indeed useful for everyone, to attract children, to increase their motivation and to improve learning.",

To undergo such an evaluation, the following issues were addressed: simulator sickness; level of presence; hazard and safety sign perception; and overall usability. Results reveal that: the AR warnings were effective in identifying hazards and in prompting compliant behaviors; and despite slight simulator sickness, participants were highly engaged, as well as adequately perceived both hazards and warnings.

These headsets come with relatively well-developed hand controllers, which can be used to interact with the virtual environment.

abstract="Personalization of online content creates filter bubbles and reinforces echo chambers. These are driven not only by natural human behaviours but also by design choices and efficiency-driven recommender systems. The traditional media policy goal of exposing citizens to diverse information to protect pluralism has not found its concrete application on social media. As the usage of social media as a news source increases, as well as personalization' sophistication and group polarization, there is a need for preventing audience fragmentation. The paper suggests serendipity as a potential design principle and, eventually, policy goal. Indeed, serendipity -- considered both as a capability and a process of seeking and processing unexpected and valuable information -- requires diverse information as a precondition and it causes cognitive diversity. Serendipity as a design principle might encompass fundamental phases of production and consumption of information, representing a positive freedom valuable from an epistemological, psychological and political perspective. With serendipity being both limited and cultivated in the digital environment, the research reveals a theoretical trade-off between relevance and serendipity (or unknown relevance) that might be tackled with serendipity-driven recommender systems and structural and informational nudging. Such approach could turn the media policy goal of exposing users to diverse information towards an experience of diversity that comes through an architecture for serendipity.",

Based on the theory of embodied interaction and disembodied interaction in cognitive science, this paper combines field research and user in-depth interviews, usability testing, SWOT analysis, SPSS questionnaire analysis, high-fidelity prototype construction, usability testing and other research data to study the interaction grammar of embodied interaction and disembodied interaction. By designing the prototype of the robot, three typical Chinese families are selected to conduct prototype tests of embodied interaction and disembodied interaction. Then on this basis, affordance, Interactive Behavior, Interactive Feedforward of embodied interaction and Mapping Relations of Symbols, Semantics and Interactive Feedback of disembodied interaction and understanding of the construction of interactive grammar are established. This study has a certain effect on embodied interaction and disembodied interaction between human and computer interaction.",

abstract="We describe the novel use of the Microsoft HoloLens to assist human operators with computer network operations tasks. We created three applications to explore how the HoloLens may aid cybersecurity practitioners. First, we developed a 3D network visualizer that displays network topologies in varying levels of detail, ranging from a global perspective down to specific properties of individual nodes. The user navigates through the topology views using hand gestures while responding to simulated alarm conditions on specific nodes. Second, we developed an application that simulates a ``capture the flag'' exercise. Third, we developed an application to test network connectivity. We discuss the benefits, challenges, and lessons learned from developing mixed-reality applications for computer network operations. We also discuss ideas for further development in this area.",

abstract="The development of mobile applications has become a means to improve the quality of life of older adults since it is possible to apply to various sectors such as medicine, for example. Also, the population aged 60 or above is growing at a rate of about 3 percent per year. Currently, rapid ageing will occur in different parts of the world as well, so that by 2050 all regions of the world except Africa will have nearly a quarter or more of their populations at ages 60 and above [45]. Likewise, it is known that older people require more time to complete tasks on mobile devices [4] and presents usability problems, so the generic developments of mobile applications do not adapt to their needs and special characteristics. For this reason, this paper addresses which are the main usability challenges that adults face when they interact with de user graphic interface of an application and how they can be made more acceptable to the target population. We summarize the relevant issues in three potential causes: visual, psychomotor and cognitive limitations. In the first category we found problems as the size and sharpness for the visual elements such characters, icons, images, charts and buttons. Also, use hard colors or inappropriate contrast color for the elements represents a significant problem to the seniors. On other hand, we found that the demand for fast and repetitive movements for interaction like moving texts or targets, the maximization in the required number of steps to complete a task and the use of scrollbars represent inconveniences in the second category for the elderly. Finally, in the last category, the most relevant issues are the use of non-significant and irrelevant graphics, or non-meaningful icons with decoration, animation or with no concise text description that goes with it. Besides, use complex texts and navigating through deep, complex and expandable menu hierarchies causes that older persons getting lost within the device menu.",

Teachers could reflect, practice and improve their use of social and emotional competences in the classrooms by using Teachers' Professional Development programs (TPD), thereby making further improvements to their teaching. These training programs could support teachers by using suitable frameworks aligned with social and emotional learning (SEL). In this paper, we highlight the significance of TPD programs by presenting a SEL workshop on SL in order to better understand and enhance Emotional Intelligent (EI) for teachers' competencies. This study reveals that after having received training in a Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) workshop on Second Life (SL), teachers `effectiveness in recognizing the EI components is highly increased.",

We first study through interviews and reviews how the bilingual reading experience is understood today. We provide an analysis framework and highlight design challenges for the design of bilingual reading appliances. We then describe a taxonomy of the different approaches available to address these challenges, analyze them in the light of our framework and show how they can be derived to sketch future bilingual reading interfaces.",

abstract="Adaptive instruction is computer-based training or education that is tailored to match the difficulty of the content to the states and traits of the learner. Since the individual differences of learners vary widely and contribute greatly to the adaptation decisions by the tutor, adaptive instructional systems (e.g., Intelligent Tutoring Systems -- ITSs) need much more content and make many more instructional decisions than non-adaptive instructional systems that instruct all learners only based on their performance level (e.g., low, moderate, high) using identical instructional strategies. Since the authoring of adaptive instruction varies with the complexity of its content and instructional decisions, it is difficult to compare the efficiency of the adaptive instructional authoring tools and methods, and the effort and skill required to use them in the construction of ITSs. This paper puts forth a methodology to assess ITS complexity and operationalize it in an index to enable adaptive instructional scientists to compare authoring tools and methods. The baseline for this initial comparative index is the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) authoring tools.",

The arrival of these technologies opens new frontiers in growing and studying artificial societies. A representation of networked enterprise as a mixed society of natural, software and hardware agents is suggested. Some fundamentals of agent theory and multi-agent systems are considered, and GRPA architecture is analyzed. The resource-based approach to enterprise modeling is taken and the principle of dependence of formal apparatus on both agent specification and architecture is formulated to justify the need in new network models extending conventional resource networks. Three basic agent types are introduced and a formalism of goal-resource networks to visualize and simulate communication between agents and formation of both multi-agent systems and artificial societies is presented. Colored goal-resource networks (CGRN) to represent these basic agent types are proposed. Some examples of communication situations and behavior strategies for «robot-robot» and «human-robot» interactions are given.",

Thus, the aim of this research is to understand the appropriateness of `habit' construct usage among UTAUT2 based empirical studies and their reason for omission or inclusion. The findings from 66 empirical studies revealed only 23 studies a meagre (35{\%}) utilised `habit' construct and the remaining massive 43 studies (65{\%}) excluded the construct from their research model. The major reason for studies not including ``habit'' construct was they were examining users of new technology at early stage of adoption where sufficient time hasn't elapsed for users to form habit. Moreover this study caution the use of experience as an alternative for habit. Since experience can be gained under mandatory settings which is not sufficient enough to form habit that occurs more naturally under voluntary settings. This study also provided number of recommendations for theory and practice based on the findings.",

The aim of this study is to examine whether a smartphone-based control is a reliable alternative to mid-air interaction for 4-DOF fist-person navigation. We setup an experiment, where users had to navigate and complete a given task in two different scenes using three input modalities. The input modalities and interaction techniques were a known Kinect-based navigation method using body tilt and shoulder rotation, a smartphone-based control though tilting and rotating the device, and a traditional keyboard-based input used as a basis of comparison. We measured quantitative data through automated monitoring of users' actions in the environment (time to finish the task, number of collisions, total collision time and distance travelled), as well as subjective user ratings through questionnaires. The results indicate that smartphone control performs at least as good as mid-air interactions with Kinect, and it was the preferred method of input in the majority of the users.",

To support it, we implemented motion sensing of exhibit visitors to allow contextual sound playback based on the visitor's location. This allowed the artist to add an audible dialogue experience to the art exhibit. We interacted with a local artist and understood the artist vision to define and agree on technical requirements. A preliminary validation at the exhibit showed general acceptance of the system, positive feedback on the experience and areas for future improvement. In general, we believe that more research is required in terms of the artist-visitor relationship mediated by technology.",

In a Wizard of Oz study, we found that, for the task of making espresso coffee, the helpfulness of visual and aural instructions depends on task complexity. Providing visual instructions is a better way of showing operation details, while aural instructions are suitable for presenting intention of operation. With the same visual instructions on displays, due to the limitation of hardware, the HMD-users complete the task in the longest duration and bear the heaviest perceived cognitive load.",

abstract="Software companies have increasingly organised hackathons since the early 2010s. These time-bounded, intensive, collaborative and solution-oriented events enable companies to generate several ideas, some of which can be used to evolve their products and services. Hackathons are means to gather feedback from outside to innovate. Companies also follow such open innovation trend by raising software ecosystems via a platformisation process. They create platforms so that third parties can develop new software solutions and in doing so extend the current product portfolio. In this scenario, a hackathon can be seen as a strategy to support ecosystem evolution. Therefore, we decided to conduct a systematic mapping study to investigate the benefits that hackathons can provide to software ecosystems. This paper presents our analysis of twenty-seven papers on corporate hackathons in the software industry. As main findings, we (i) describe a set of fourteen social, technical and business benefits; as well as (ii) discuss how companies can leverage ecosystem health by conducting hackathons. We address the scarcity of research around the outcomes of corporate hackathons. Besides, we conclude that hackathons are alternative modes of production and innovation, which can catalyse a software ecosystem.",

abstract="This paper explores the interaction of humans and autonomous, intelligent agents working together as teammates in cyberspace operations. Though much research has investigated human-machine teams in domains such as robotics, there is a dearth of research into human-agent dynamics in cyberspace operations Some challenges are similar, such as trust between human and agent. Other challenges, such as representation and interface, are unique to cyberspace given that topological, logical, and temporal relationships are first class constructs with different semantic interpretations from their counterpart visual and spatial representations that are prevalent in physical domains. These challenges arise as the software behaves less like a tool and increasingly becomes more like a synthetic teammate.",

Millions of people are exposed to the risk of extreme floods and storms. It is therefore crucial to develop analytical tools that allow us to evaluate the threats of floods and to investigate the influence of mitigation and adaptation measures, such as stronger dikes, adaptive spatial planning, and flood disaster plans. The objective of our work is to present a flood management system that aims to model and visualize floods. It provides realistic images to help users in understanding and interpreting these disaster scenarios. In order to investigate the applicability in practice, we illustrated the use of our system for real-world data in a case study for the city of Paris, France.",

Such environments occur anytime feedback loops contribute to the resultant states of independent variables. These types of environments are becoming both more common and more pervasive in everyday life. Digital platforms are becoming increasingly complex. Recommendation systems are becoming a part of everyday life. These authors have focused previous efforts upon first outlining statistical techniques useful for nonlinear systems and more recently upon incorporating such techniques within a decision making framework. This system is designed to provide deep insight into complex non-linear environments and augment the user's effectiveness in managing risk. This paper will focus upon the application and extension of the DEAR framework to the inherent complexity of naturalistic environments. It will offer an example of an embodiment of this approach into a DSS as a part of an embodiment support system (ESS). Finally, it will advocate the creation of hybrid DSS/ESS architectures.",

abstract="Autonomous mobile robots are often videotaped during operation, whether for later evaluation by their developers or for demonstration of the robots to others. Watching such videos is engaging and interesting. However, clearly the plain videos do not show detailed information about the algorithms running on the moving robots, leading to a rather limited visual understanding of the underlying autonomy. Researchers have resorted to following the autonomous robots algorithms through a variety of methods, most commonly graphical user interfaces running on offboard screens and separated from the captured videos. Such methods enable considerable debugging, but still have limited effectiveness, as there is an inevitable visual mismatch with the video capture. In this work, we aim to break this disconnect, and we contribute the ability to overlay visualizations onto a video, to extract the robot's algorithms, in particular to follow its route planning and execution. We further provide mechanisms to create and visualize virtual adaptations of the real environment to enable the exploration of the behavior of the algorithms in new situations. We demonstrate the complete implementation with an autonomous quadrotor navigating in a lab environment using the rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm. We briefly motivate and discuss our follow-up visualization work for our complex small-size robot soccer team.",

The research direction of this paper is to explore the influence of the size of the graphic element in the interactive interface on the dynamic gesture behavior through the behavior experiment of the user. In the paper, the researcher observes the gestures when interacting with objects of the different size in the virtual space, and then, researchers analyzes the correlation between the size of object and the dynamic gesture.

A solo robot control paradigm was compared with a dual condition in which an alternate (surrogate) perspective was provided via voice commands to a second robot employed as a highly autonomous teammate. Subjective and neurophysiological measurements indicate an increased level of situational awareness was achieved in the dual condition along with a reduction decision oriented task engagement.

This improvement in exploration and analysis of software systems applies no matter the production stage. This product allows researchers, designers and developers to quickly develop new or modify existing UIs as designers work alongside Fleet users in a collaborative design effort. The design effort applies to existing or novel missions utilizing tasks and CONOPs as drivers for meaningful requirements and design input. The UIPT toolkit effort is targeted to Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and Cyber missions for the U.S. Navy. UIPT enables the Navy to significantly reduce the risks associated with pursuing revolutionary technology such as autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and distributed sensing in terms of the design of the user interface.

abstract="Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are not yet widely implemented in learning, despite the general prevalence of digital resources in educational and training environments. ITS have been demonstrated to be effective for learners, but ITS development is not yet efficient for authors. Creating an ITS requires time, resources, and multidisciplinary skills. Authoring tools are intended to reduce the time and skill required to create an ITS, but the current state of those tools is categorized as a series of design tradeoffs between functionality, generalizability, and usability. In practice, the former two factors matter little if potential authors disregard the ITS in favor of other solutions. In this sense, authors, not learners, are the primary users of an ITS; the user experience of authors is critical to greater ITS adoption at an organizational level. With those challenges in mind, ongoing work and lessons learned on the design of authoring tools are described for a specific ITS platform, the Generalized Framework for Intelligent Tutoring (GIFT). User-centered design considerations are examined through the lens of authors' goals, mental models for authoring, and the definition of authoring sub-roles. Recommendations for authoring tool design and future research directions for design research in authoring tools are discussed.",

Indeed, often the results of this short collaboration are not as previously imagined. In this paper, we introduce the concept of instant rephotography, a technique based on a simple and intuitive user interface, and in an efficient and low cost algorithm that finds the matching between two images. The user interface guides the photographer to position the camera in the right place that was once imagined by the camera owner, automatically taking the new photo. To correctly choose the new photo, we propose an algorithm based on ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature points acquired from the reference and current photos, and on inertial sensors embedded in the photo device, a smartphone. To validate the concepts introduced, we implemented an Android App called Smart-Tourist Camera, conceived to help tourists to take good pictures during travels. Three different user studies involving 124 volunteers were conducted and results have shown that the photographs taken with the application are perceived as better than otherwise, and that users would use the App during their travels.",

The objective of this review is: (a) to present the empirical evidence of games for serious purposes as an effective vehicle to transfer moral value orientations and positive emotions; (b) to identify the explored area of the game impact and evaluate the effectiveness of a game impact from the previous studies; (c) to summarize different game assessments and study designs of the previous studies; (d) to define future research perspectives. After searching several influential databases, 26 relevant articles were included in the study. This review provided empirical evidences that games for serious purposes may improve young people's prosocial behaviour, empathy, emotion regulation, mental health and moral belief. Furthermore, these games can change people's attitude, affect people's behaviour and even influence people's psychological state. This review made a comprehensive summary of game assessment including in- and out off-game assessment and detailed analysis of study designs from the previous study. The current finding reveals that studies about prosocial games are of relatively good quality, and that there is great potential for the study of games regarding empathy and moral development. Besides, in accordance with Johnson and Hall's Job Demand-Control-Support (JDCS) model, a new and innovative way of classifying games is proposed: purpose-driven, action-driven, mode-driven and game context-driven.",

abstract="The digital revolution has deeply transformed the educational materials, especially for children, in a pathway going from physical objects to digital ones. In this paper, after delineating some relevant milestones in this route, one further step is delineated which proposes multisensory materials for learning. These kind of materials keep the main advantages of physical educational materials and marry them with the ones derived from the digital world. Then, an example of multisensory materials for learning is introduced: STTory, which is dedicated to multisensory storytelling, together with results about one study on this material which indicate that introducing multisensory elements in digital materials has positive effects on learning in children. Multisensory educational materials provide multimodal input for learning individual, enriching learning environments and educational scenarios.",

abstract="With the breakthrough of the confinements of materials by Screen Technology, it has ushered in another kind of expression mode, which is detached from the sense of distance featured by technology and is fused with the realistic world. The appearance of the screen media which surpasses the definition of papers but has costs lower than paper would once again subvert the human visual experience and life habits. As a kind of new means of visual language, since the 1960s, interface design has brought the world brand new design concepts and design norms. The human beings' entry into the intelligent era has been much more rapid than expected, and this has brought design tremendous impacts and challenges, but has also brought the designers boundless possibilities. Under the influence of visual language for interface designs, designers wonder how to conduct designs and in reverse it would aid such an era to a certain place. The Author proposes that in the visual language for interface designs there exists a developmental trend from ``fear to be unseen'' to ``fear to be seen''; meanwhile it is also proposed that the visual language for interface designs features profound effects and behavior planning on the conventional graphic design. This Paper holds that there would be no development of interface design without the screen, and the development map of the interface designs would put forward new requirements on the development process of the screen. It can be said that the screen has shaped the temperament of the modern technological society featuring constant fusion and merging. The appearance of the screen established a boundary, but this boundary possesses boundless integration and merging ability, and this is not only manifested in the externalized substance, but is more manifested in people's hearts. The boundary between substances is disappearing.",

abstract="20th century industrial heritage, hardly a mainstream area of study, is rarely presented in exhibitions to the general public in Spain. Many abandoned industrial heritage sites are simply left to deteriorate with no attempt to learn from their past. In this paper, the construction and validation of three different Virtual Reality environments are reported. These Virtual Reality environments will be included in an exhibition on some of the first factories established in Burgos (Spain) in the 1960s. The environments were generated using different 3D head-mounted displays - Oculus Rift{\texttrademark} and card-boards, and 2D Displays running under different game engines such as Unreal Engine and Unity. Three environments were created: a 2D-virtual tour game in a small factory manufacturing steel sheets; a 3D-mobile virtual reality window to follow the expansion of a small car-component manufacturer into a leading TIER1 automotive sector company; and, a final general overview of the effect of the new companies on the development of the city using Oculus Rift displays. This research focuses on the advantages of each technology for a different objective and the analysis of the effort required to run it properly in a final application, concluding that the game engine Unreal Engine provides more photorealistic results in 3D-environments with high user-interaction capabilities, while Unity is better in 360{\textordmasculine} environments that show time evolution running on devices such as mobile phones, with low-computing power.",

For this purpose, users were asked to show the commands they would perform when realizing basic navigation tasks within a virtual world, and they were observed following the Wizard of Oz approach. The performance gesture-based interaction is evaluated in terms of usability, contrasted with traditional desktop interaction, and analyzed.

abstract="In this paper, we present a web-based system for visualization of flow simulation results in the vascular system for use with consumer-level hardware. The presented tool allows users to design, execute and visualize a flow simulation with a simple workflow on a desktop computer or a mobile device. The web interface allows users to select a vascular model, define the flow simulation parameters, execute the simulation, and interactively visualize the simulation results in real time using multiple visualization techniques. The server-side prepares the model for simulation and performs the simulation using SimVascular. To provide a more efficient transfer of the large amounts of simulation results to the web client, as well as reduce storage requirements on the server, we introduce a novel hybrid lossy compression method. The method uses an octree data subdivision approach combined with an iterative approach that regresses the data points to a B-Spline volume. The evaluation results show that our method achieves compression ratios of up to 5.7 for the tested examples at a given error rate, comparable to other approaches while specifically intended for visualization purposes.",

This has lead to the development of specialised software tools to support academic research on such platforms. However, the loose coupling of the software with the crowdsourcing site means that there is only limited access to the features of the platform. In addition, the specialised nature of the software tools means that technical knowledge is needed to operate them. Hence there is great potential to enrich the features of crowdsourcing platforms from an academic perspective.

With the help of depth information, the capturing process becomes more robust and efficient. In this physical mini-pool table, an inexperienced user can pick a cue and hit a ball easier to get practical training in a game of billiards. However, distance perception is very critical in training. The display simulating the motion parallax effect is helpful for the user to perceive the distance and orientation in a virtual simulation.

abstract="Musculo Skeletal Disorders (MSDs) is the most common disease in the workplaces causing disabilities and excessive costs to industries, particularly in EU countries. Most of MSDs prevention programs have focused on a combination of interventions including training to change individual behaviors (such as awkward postures). However, little evidence proves that current training approach on awkward postures is efficient and can significantly reduce MSDs symptoms. Therefore, dealing with awkward postures and repetitive tasks is the real challenge for practitioners and manufacturers, knowing that the amount of risk exposure varies increasingly among workers depending on their attitude and expertise as well as on their strategy to perform the task. The progress in MSDs prevention might come through developing new tools that inform workers more efficiently on their gestures and postures. This paper proposes a potential Serious Game that immerses industrial workers using Virtual Reality and helps them recognize their strategy while performing tasks and trains them to find the most efficient and least risky tactics.",

The exchange of information in real time between the two software is essential because the advanced control algorithms require a feedback from the robot-environment interaction to close the control loop, while the simulated robot updates its kinematic and dynamic parameters depending on controllability variables calculated by MATLAB. Finally, the 3D simulator is evaluated by implementing an autonomous control scheme to solve the problem of path following of a 6DOF robot arm, also the results obtained by implementing the tele-operation scheme for said robot are presented.",

abstract="Gamification, which uses game design elements in non-game contexts, has already proved to be successful in different domains. Within the tourism industry it offers several benefits to DMOs, such as encouraging engagement, enhancing experiences, improving loyalty, or increasing brand awareness of tourists. However, examples of DMOs applying gamification for the on-site phase of the trip and validation of its impact on destinations are still lacking. This could be caused due to the scarcity of tools to generate gamified mobile experiences. This paper focuses on these issues presenting hypotheses about the capacity of DMOs to generate these experiences; and the benefits of these experiences for DMOs. To validate these hypotheses, staff from three DMOs have generated gamified mobile experiences with an authoring tool designed and developed to target their needs and technological knowledge level.",

abstract="Continuous media capture via a wearable devices is currently one of the most popular methods to establish a comprehensive record of the entirety of an individual's life experience, referred to in the research community as a lifelog. These vast multimodal corpora include visual and other sensor data and are enriched by content analysis, to generate as extensive a record of an individual's life experience. However, interfacing with such datasets remains an active area of research, and despite the advent of new technology and a plethora of competing mediums for processing digital information, there has been little focus on newly emerging platforms such as virtual reality. In this work, we suggest that the increase in immersion and spatial dimensions provided by virtual reality could provide significant benefits to users when compared to more conventional access methodologies. Hence, we motivate virtual reality as a viable method of exploring multimedia archives (specifically lifelogs) by performing a baseline comparative analysis using a novel application prototype built for the HTC Vive and a conventional prototype built for a standard personal computer.",

abstract="Automation pervades workplaces in an increasing pace and its effects on work practices and roles are far-reaching. Work tasks are typically automated with efficiency, effectiveness and safety in mind, but less attention is paid on the user experience aspects. As the amount of direct human control over technology is often decreased with automation, the human aspect of those systems might seem less essential and thus human-system interaction designers may not be consulted when automation is designed. Yet, fully autonomous and unmanned systems are rare, as humans often still have to monitor, intervene, maintain and control the automated environments -- be it on-site or remotely. This paper discusses the need for better interaction design of automated systems with a focus on engaging user experiences in work environments. Results of a systematic literature on engaging user experience design in automation solutions used at work revealed that experiential human-automation interaction design is a neglected research topic. Therefore, we call for more research on automation design that improves not only efficiency, i.e., the pragmatic aspects of user experience, but also employee engagement and other emotional aspects of user experience. It is time for a turn to the experiential to take place also in the work automation context.",

abstract="Current telemedicine systems for remote medical consultation are based on decades old video-conferencing technology. Their primary role is to deliver video and voice communication between medical providers and to transmit vital signs of the patient. This technology, however, does not provide the expert physician with the same hands-on experience as when examining a patient in person. Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR and AR) on the other hand have the capacity to enhance the experience and communication between healthcare professionals in geographically distributed locations. By transmitting RGB+D video of the patient, the expert physician can interact with this real-time 3D representation in novel ways. Furthermore, the use of AR technology at the patient side has potential to improve communication by providing clear visual instructions to the caregiver. In this paper, we propose a framework for 3D real-time communication that combines interaction via VR and AR. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework on a prototype system consisting of a depth camera, projector and 3D display. The system is used to analyze the network performance and data transmission quality of the multimodal streaming in a remote scenario.",

However, the design requirements and best practices for interaction with S3D touch screen user interfaces are only now evolving. To understand the challenges and limitations S3D technology brings to interaction design, and in particular the additional demands they place on the users of such interfaces, we present our research that considers stereoscopic touch screens of different sizes in static and mobile usage contexts.

abstract="This essay deals with the representation of cities focusing on their historical transformations and relying on digital scanning, 3D modeling and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies. The instances shown in it come from a project titled Visualizing Venice, an international multi-institutional cooperation now shifting to Visualizing Cities. The main challenge of Visualizing Cities is to digitally describe how cities -- with their architectures -- evolve and change over time using an interoperable 4D digital model linked to external sources, such as historic images. Experiencing the workflow of such a digital model a current lack of interoperability between CAD and GIS systems has emerged. This problem is particularly evident in the transition from digital scanning to a Building Information Model (BIM). This gap must be filled because a representational database, such as a 3D BIM model, helps researchers in representing architectural and urban history in all its phases. It makes the users able to control any kind of information: from recording the current state of an urban environment to the interpretation of historical records; from 3D reconstruction of data to their dissemination at different levels of complexity. This paper shows new methodologies in this field and, relating to historical data, attempts to answer also an important question: what kind of information can we get from paintings that show a city view? Representation methods based on perspective rules offer the opportunity to obtain scientific data on how to implement the BIM model correctly.",

However, these human abilities can benefit from rapidly growing computational capabilities. We can apply computational power to support and augment cognitive skills that will bolster the limited human cognitive resource and provide new capabilities through this symbiosis. We now have the ability to design human-computer interaction capabilities where the computer anticipates, predicts, and augments the performance of the user and where the human supports, aids, and enhances the learning and performance of the computer. Augmented cognition seeks to advance this human-machine symbiosis through both machine understanding of the human (such as physical state sensing, cognitive state sensing, psychophysiology, emotion detection, and intent projection) and human understanding of the machine (such as explainable AI, shared situation awareness, trust enhancement, and advanced UX). The ultimate result being a truly interactive symbiosis where humans and computers are tightly coupled in productive partnerships that merge the best of the human with the best of the machine. As advances in artificial intelligence (AI) accelerate across a myriad of applications, we seek to understand the current state-of-the-art of AI and how it may be best applied for advancing human-machine symbiosis.",

abstract="A Computerized Operator Support System (COSS) has been envisioned and prototyped for nuclear power plant (NPP) operations. The COSS supports operator decision making during abnormal events by making use of an online fault-diagnostic system known as PRO-AID. PRO-AID uses existing sensors and confluence equations to detect system faults before plant threshold alarms would alert operators. In a full-scope, full-scale nuclear power plant simulator we demonstrated that early diagnosis in conjunction with computer-based-procedures can assist operators in mitigating faults in circumstances that would normally lead to shutting down the plant. Here we conceive of a computerized plant management system (CPMS) that would complement COSS. COSS is intended to aid in the short-time scale operations of a plant. The CPMS is aimed at supporting longer time-scale activities involving maintenance, calibration, and early warning fault detection. Digitization allows staff to manage and monitor assets remotely without being physically present locally at the equipment under surveillance. This allows for specialization by equipment and systems rather than location. Cyber-physical systems and the industrial internet of things have no shortage of possibilities and promises, but often the benefits come with conflicting considerations: availability may tradeoff with increased cyber risk, increased redundancy may come at the cost of increased complexity, outsourcing engineering requires more communication across organizations and the associated administrative burden. In too many instances, humans tend to fill the gaps between what automation cannot reliably or cost-effectively accomplish. Human-centered design using human factors considers the role of the human as part of a human-machine-system. Our COSS concept examined how a control system, a diagnostic system, expert guidance system, and computer-based procedure system could work in concert to aid operator actions. Here we examine the potential for human factors and human-centered design for whole plant management using a CPMS. A CPMS could serve several valuable functions from providing computerized procedures for field operations to using prognostics for early failure detection, or managing information flows from sensors to business networks, system engineers, cyber-security personnel, and third-party vendors.",

abstract="Pok{\'e}mon Go (PG) is one of the most successful mobile games in recent history. The uniqueness of PG appears to be its combination of augmented reality (AR) and location-based gaming. In the game, players use a mobile device's positioning capability to locate, capture, and battle the in-game creatures (called Pok{\'e}mon), which are blended into the real environment and visible there through the mobile screen. The game accrued over 550 million installs in its first 80 days since launch, but player interest faded fast. PG had lost at least a third of its daily users by the middle of August 2016. So far, little is known why players continue or discontinue play. Understanding this will be vital to the future success of PG. Extant explanations of player participation in games focus predominantly on the impact of immersion. It appears that PG offers possibilities for creating various immersive experiences, which sustain players' continuance intention. However, the construct of immersion has yet to be well established and the role of immersion in the AR context remains unclear. To fill these gaps in research, this study seeks to investigate different immersive experiences and their impacts on a player's continuance intention. The paper reports on the result of a qualitative survey with 92 Pok{\'e}mon players, and affirms that sensory immersion, spatial immersion, tactical immersion, strategic immersion, narrative immersion, and social immersion are key determinants of players' continuance intention. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

But is it enough for a software product to just have an intuitive user interface to give a natural experience? Designing for a product imbibing overall naturalness requires encompassing of all the aspects of user experience, which is beyond just an interface design. This study contributes by taking a holistic approach in identifying what users perceive to be natural and what experiences make them feel so. We involved 36 participants with diverse demographics and personalities, giving them a variety of stimuli to elicit their perceptions of naturalness. These were found to be a combination of what they perceived to be natural through visual, cognitive as well as real life past and present experiences. The insights from this research helped us in deriving inferences on designing for what we call as Natural User Experience (NUX). We found that the level of naturalness does not remain same over time for the users; rather it goes through a stage based cycle. We also evolved strategies for improving the naturalness by advancing user's experience across these stages.",

abstract="Crowdsourcing enables new possibilities for QoE evaluation by moving the evaluation task from the traditional laboratory environment into the Internet, allowing researchers to easily access a global pool of workers for the evaluation task. This makes it not only possible to include a more diverse population and real-life environments into the evaluation, but also reduces the turn-around time and increases the number of subjects participating in an evaluation campaign significantly, thereby circumventing bottle-necks in traditional laboratory setups. In order to utilise these advantages, the differences between laboratory-based and crowd-based QoE evaluation are discussed in this chapter.",

abstract="This paper presents a scalable model-based approach for 3D scene reconstruction using a moving RGB-D camera. The proposed approach enhances the accuracy of pose estimation due to exploiting the rich information in the multi-channel RGB-D image data. Our approach has lots of advantages on the reconstruction quality of the 3D scene as compared with the conventional approaches using sparse features for pose estimation. The pre-learned image-based 3D model provides multiple templates for sampled views of the model, which are used to estimate the poses of the frames in the input RGB-D video without the need of a priori internal and external camera parameters. Through template-to-frame registration, the reconstructed 3D scene can be loaded in an augmented reality (AR) environment to facilitate displaying, interaction, and rendering of an image-based AR application. Finally, we verify the ability of the established reconstruction system on publicly available benchmark datasets, and compare it with the sate-of-the-art pose estimation algorithms. The results indicate that our approach outperforms the compared methods on the accuracy of pose estimation.",

abstract="Locating an object in an unfamiliar and dense physical environment, such as a control room, supermarket, or warehouse, can be challenging. In this paper, we present the Projection-Augmented Arm (PAA), a motorized robotic arm augmented with a pico-projector to help users to localize targets in such environments. The arm moves and displays a projected spotlight on the target. We present the results of a study that shows that the PAA helps users to more quickly locate target objects in a dense environment. We further study the influence of the visibility of the projected spotlight while moving versus that of the physical movement of the projection arm on user performance and search strategy, finding that (1) information about the orientation of the arm has a stronger impact on performance than moving spotlight projected on the search space; (2) the orientation of the arm is useful (24 {\%} improvement) and especially when the target is behind the user (26 {\%} improvement); and (3) users' strategies relied mainly on the arm when it is visible.",

At the same time, cognitive recovery in topographical disorientation was treated with the use of virtual reality simulations specifically developed for the clinical intervention. After a four-week period (twelve one-hour sessions) the participant (a forty-eight years old male patient) showed an improved ability in cognitive tasks that requires orientation in not simulated and virtual reality environments and an improvement in walking valuable from physiotherapy standards.

abstract="Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are considered as the emerging components for Industry 4.0, the state-of-the art and standard CPS architecture playing the major role in understanding the nature of the industrial landscape. The key problem with traditional CPS architectures is that they are not up-to-mark and convincing to fulfil the needs of smart industries, as they merely consider vertical and horizontal integration with three components (i.e., human, cyber and physical components) integration. Currently, CPS lack adopting and highlighting the key interfacing elements which are vital for Industry 4.0. So, to remedy these problems and bridge the gap between concepts and implementing, this paper proposes to enhance the 3C CPS architecture based on the traditional 3C one for Industry 4.0 by adopting the main interfacing elements such as connectors, protocols, and sub-elements, for example human, cyber and physical parts. Hence, it can be said that the proposed enhanced 3C CPS architecture plays a significant role and will be considered as a guideline and application for future smart manufacturing CPS systems and industries.",

abstract="Social networks have a significant role in the tourism sector: both on the demand and on the supply. They are an important information source for travelers, allowing destination makers to `socialize' and share information and comments with users and possible visitors. Leveraging off social media to market destinations has proven to be an excellent strategy as largely recognized in several studies focused on the comprehension of importance of social media in the online tourism market (Chung and Buhalis, 2008; Inversini and Buhalis 2009; Xiang and Gretzel 2010). Following these developments, tourism managers have started to put in practice new strategies that exploit social media tools in order to promote and incentive tourism in the area. Therefore, the primary purpose of the study is to show how digital strategies and, especially, the use of social media tools, may be critical to enable tourism destination competitiveness. The main objective is to analyse a destination digital strategy aimed to define the best features to perform a winning digital strategy that allows to promote and market a tourist destination on the web. Framed in the above premises, a benchmark of some Italian e-destinations best practice examples [ENIT 2015 Blogmeter 2015 have been conducted with the aim to comprehend trends and main features of the use of technologies and applications. The chosen cases are, then, analysed more in depth, through a qualitative online exploratory survey. The results obtained from a contemporary and successful Italian DMO, evidence the criteria enabling a competive 2.0 tourism strategy.",

Digital traces from social networks developed in PortoAlegre.cc, a collaborative web map registering issues and use of urban space, were used as data input for this research. Social network analysis was used as approach permitting network structures evaluation. The results reveal the existence of short paths, with predominance of structures that follow Small World model.

abstract="In this paper, we propose and implement a system based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to create novel car designs from a minimal design studio sketch. A key component of our architecture is a novel convolutional filter layer, that produces sketches similar to those drawn by designers during rapid prototyping. The sketches produced are more aesthetic than the ones from standard edge detection filters or gradient operations. In addition, we show that our system is able to generate hitherto unseen perspectives of a car, given a sketch of the car at just a single viewing angle. For extensive training, testing and validation of our system, we have developed a comprehensive, paired dataset of around 100,000 car images (with transparent backgrounds) and their respective sketches. Our work augments human intelligence and creativity using machine learning and deep neural networks. Our system has the significant benefit of reducing the cycle time in the sketch-to-image process which has largely been considered a creative domain. This is achieved by learning to interpret a preliminary sketch drawn by a designer, to generate novel visual designs in a matter of seconds, which may otherwise require considerable time and effort. While the system enhances the productivity of the designer, the machine learning enhanced design visualizations can cut costs during the product prototyping stage. Our system exhibits good impactful potential for the automobile industry and can be easily adapted to industries which require creative intelligence.",

abstract="When formulating prescriptive design knowledge in design science research (DSR), we usually reflect on our vision of created artifacts, relevant design decisions, and what we have learned throughout the design process. Seldom do we attempt to extract prescriptive knowledge from existing and widely acknowledged artifacts in the manner of ex-post facto or in situ. But what can we learn from decades of designing digital artifacts that have fundamentally revamped work processes across industries, allowed for the emergence of new business models, and even spurred entirely new industries? This essay is inspired by the way archaeologists make sense of the past and represent the resulting knowledge. We propose a novel approach to the analysis of digital artifacts based on the archaeological approaches to context reconstruction and artifact analysis. We explain how a design archaeologist can shift among the perspectives of designers, users, and the generated artifact to make inferences about the artifact (i.e., design artifact), how it has been designed (i.e., design process), the context in which it has been designed (i.e., the design context), and the situations in which it has been used (i.e., the use contexts).",

Two adolescent cases have been modeled using avatars and a digital puppetry system that allows for complex and nuanced non-verbal behavior. After several iterations, a combination of gesture based puppetry, real-time head tracking, and triggered automated animation sequences was found to provide suitable control to create subtle and appropriate non-verbal behaviors in the context of the interview.

Although humans remain the most flexible entity in modern production systems, the increasing complexity of these systems presents a challenge for the operators with regards to remaining efficient. Research related to Industry 4.0 has promoted the application of digital assistance systems, as a method of augmenting human operators to handle the complexity of these production systems better. However, no digital assistance system that supports human operators in performing manual changeover operations in complex production systems has been identified. This paper, therefore, presents a conceptual digital assistance system, which utilizes information about two consecutive production configurations, and processes this data through an algorithm, to determine which specific changeover operations are required to perform a changeover most efficiently. Potentials of implementing the proposed digital assistance system are briefly introduced, and topics for further research are outlined.",

abstract="Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Autism is considered as a psychological neurodevelopment disorder which affects people. It is characterized by a wide range of conditions that difficult their social skills, as well as their verbal and non-verbal communication. According to the Centers for Disease Control, Autism affects an estimated 1 in 59 children in the USA. Technological advances seek to benefit the most vulnerable groups of society, creating tools that enhance the development of their abilities and skills. In this sense, Serious Games are structure-oriented videogames designed to learning or therapies in a fun environment. With this principle, ``JOINME'' game was developed using a natural user interface to benefit the progress of interpersonal relationships in children aged between 5 and 10, diagnosed with high-functioning ASD. For experimentation, a case study was applied. It was built from the adaptation of the KidsLife scale through a pre-test and post-test. As a result, a significant improvement of 8.17{\%} in the development of interpersonal relationships was obtained in the kids. It reinforced their mathematical reasoning, recognition of emotions, and comprehensive reading.",

abstract="The rapid increase in integration of intelligent systems in every corner of technology created an emerging field called Human-Machine Teaming (HMT). In HMT, human and machine collaborate with one another to accomplish a common goal or task. To achieve the best performance of a team, it is necessary to build trust and cohesion among all teammates (machines and humans). Furthermore, in a team, it is an established fact that a team member ability to predict fellow member's future course of action and have an accurate picture is a valuable asset and will result in better team dynamics and team performance. To realize such an ability we are proposing a human error predicting methodology that could give an intelligent system a better understanding of human actions in advance. In the proposed method, we used eye-tracking metrics such as gaze density and cognitive state to predict human errors. The results obtained with the proposed and developed methods are found to be efficient in predicting human error probability.",

abstract="We propose a new multiplanar superstructure for unified real-time processing of RGB-D data. Modern RGB-D sensors are widely used for indoor 3D capture, with applications ranging from modeling to robotics, through augmented reality. Nevertheless, their use is limited by their low resolution, with frames often corrupted with noise, missing data and temporal inconsistencies. Our approach, named Proxy Clouds, consists in generating and updating through time a single set of compact local statistics parameterized over detected planar proxies, which are fed from raw RGB-D data. Proxy Clouds provide several processing primitives, which improve the quality of the RGB-D stream on-the-fly or lighten further operations. Experimental results confirm that our light weight analysis framework copes well with embedded execution as well as moderate memory and computational capabilities compared to state-of-the-art methods. Processing of RGB-D data with Proxy Clouds includes noise and temporal flickering removal, hole filling and resampling. As a substitute of the observed scene, our proxy cloud can additionally be applied to compression and scene reconstruction. We present experiments performed with our framework in indoor scenes of different natures within a recent open RGB-D dataset.",

In addition to its role as a historical source the historic school photograph is also a powerful visual mnemonic stimulus referring to what, in advanced societies, is a universally shared life experience: the schooling experience, in which people from different social, cultural and generational provenance can recognize themselves. School photography thus represents a ``social object'' par excellence, i.e. it is able to attract the attention of people and encourage them to talk to each other in order to recall and share common memories. Through social media, in fact, it is exactly this intrinsic social-relational function of school photographs which seems to amplify by catalysing the web-users' interests, evoking shared memories, building connections between people. Through significant examples and case-studies, the author offers an initial review of the social practices to which school photographs are subjected today on the Web and social media, which show how new life can be breathed into the photographic heritage of schools---too often forgotten in our archives, libraries, museums, schools and houses.",

abstract="Exergames are becoming increasingly popular as a way of motivating people to exercise. How to use games to increase personal exercise motivation has become an important issue both for HCI researchers and interaction designers. While many exergames can attract users, not all of them have the ability to sustain high levels of motivation over time. The incentive effect of exergames can not only rely on freshness and gameplay, but should adopt other long-term effective means. In most cases, exergames truly reflect the user's status of exercise, as time, speed, heart rate, calorie consumption, etc. In the field of sports psychology, existing research shows that people's cognitive bias in the process of exercise can be manipulated artificially, thus affecting the behavior and exertion of the athlete. However, it has not been found that the designer deliberately integrated benevolent deception into the case of exergame design. As a design concept, benevolent deception has not been widely discussed. We investigate how to apply benevolent deception on exergame design, to verify the possibility of using benevolent deception as a fitness incentive in gym. We developed a set of basic design principles, as promoting fitness by lies is an unusual and dangerous design attempt. Taking the spinning cycle game as an example, we try to introduce benevolent deception into the interactive game design of aerobic exercise. After the design process, we discussed the key impact, main challenge, necessary of drawing on expert opinions.",

We, therefore, propose that the established practice of strategic design be applied to cultural institutions as an appropriate process with which to build innovative museum systems. From the starting point of the assumptions that museums perform an important social function and should build empathic relationships with their stakeholders we stress the importance of building a design driven system led by co-curation work capable of involving stakeholders proactively with their various skills. Finally, we will suggest guidelines, a minimum mapping of the main existing communication artifacts and some practical examples of transmedia devices created ad hoc for the achievement of a range of conceptual innovative museum model frameworks. In conclusion the designer's role as activator of a continuous process of interpretation of phenomena, in the capacity of mediator, with an ability to translate the real world and different languages and achieve concrete artifacts using the most advanced technologies emerges.",

We propose using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) in the early stages of design projects to highlight components with high risk of failure. Identifying these components of high risk can inform how resources should be best used on costly modelling tasks. In addition, high risk components may impose functional modelling requirements, which in turn will inform the design of flexible systems for critical areas. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce risk by focusing and informing modelling efforts, which in turn increases the chance of success of the project and lowers costs for all stakeholders involved.",

In order to enhance the interaction experience between driver and back-seat passenger, we propose the concept of ``AEIC'' (Augmented Emoji in Car). By modifying the existing in-car equipment with information augment, we can offer multi-modal ways of interaction inside the car for the driver and back-seat passenger, so that they can have a better mutual understanding of each other under the premise of safe drive regulations. By optimizing the current central rear-view mirror, the mood of back-seat passenger can be detected and judged by means of facial recognition. Though the sound, light and Emoji, the passenger's current emotional state will be fed back to the driver. In order to test the designed scheme, we constructed a vehicle driving simulator experimental platform with highly free scalability to obtain interactive data to conduct the user research. We invited 20 participants to participate in our prototype test, by observing them simulating the driving scenes we designed in the platform, their interactive feedback information can be precisely collected. Then we conducted depth interviews with the users about the earlier experience of interactions in the simulated scenario to obtain the reference information for further design iterations.",

Our preliminary evaluation failed to provide solid evidence on the development of feelings of closeness. However, the majority of children participating in our test found the record function of the product enjoyable, while the majority of parents thought MUVA would be a fun communication method.

abstract="The core of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is to analyze and understand the user's intension, which can be mostly manifested from the facial movement and expression of the user. Hence, the stage facial detection and tracking is extremely important in an user-friendly interface between human and computer. In ULSee, we developed an ultrafast markerless facial tracking system which is robust to variation in environmental lighting, pose and occlusion. It can be run at a speed of 10 ms/frame on an iPhone 6S system. With such accuracy and speed, it can be used to support many intelligent HCI applications. In this work, we envision an intelligent lifestyle in the future that can be built upon the basis of the ULSee's ultrafast markerless facial tracker, ranging from virtual reality, augmented reality, real-time facial recognition and driver drowsiness detection. We believe, that through the joint force between ULSee's world-class tracker and our clients, more user-awareness HCI application will be invented and a new lifestyle will arise.",

abstract="Mobile communication and mobile computing has revolutionized the way subscribers across the globe leverage and use a variety of services on the go. Mobile devices have evolved from mere simple handheld mobile phones that enabled voice calls only a few years back to smartphone devices that enable the user to access applications and value-added services anytime, anyplace. All of these, together with the recent reigniting of cloud computing technology, has spearheaded into the opportunistic and economically viable Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) as the next innovative technology and ultimately a utility wave such as electricity or water. But this has created huge loopholes in facilitating reliable, scalable, performance oriented, safe, secure and auditable trusted services at affordable prices and profitability. Thus, this research proposal aims to create a fully-fledged Mobile Commerce-based Safe Mobile Cloud Computing (MCSMCC) framework to specifically accommodate Safe MCC (SMCC) with economic pricing models and e-trading schemes. As for the safety measures comprising of security, privacy, trust, identity management, audit and digital forensics among other related measures to suit SMCC, the objectives are to define and specify the necessary processes and protocols for secure e-trading, These objectives are further complimented by further defining and specifying SMCC pricing schemes that will be fair and equitable to users and vendors alike, and encourage critical mass market uptake and usage with confidence. Both of these central objectives will be experimented through simulation and prototyping to test and verify their purpose, effectiveness and efficiency.",

First, we present an overview of the IoT and the importance of trust in relation to it, and then we provide an in-depth trust/reliable management protocol for the IoT and evaluate comparable trust management protocols. We also investigate a scalable solution for trust management in the IoT and provide a comparative evaluation of existing trust solutions. We then present a context-aware assessment for the IoT and compare the different trust solutions. Lastly, we give a full comparative analysis of trust/reliability management in the IoT.

Coupled with extensions to commonly used applications to report user interactions in a meaningful way, the workstation will allow the development of a rich contextual user model that is accurate enough to enable benefits, such as contextual filtering, task automation, contextual auto-fill, and improved understanding of team collaborations. SRI's bRIGHT workstation was designed and built to explore these research avenues and investigate how such a context model can be built, identify the key implications in designing an application model that best serves these goals, and discover other related factors.

pages="432--439",
abstract="In this paper, we introduce ``HandyTool'' a method (and an interface) for virtual object manipulation based on a metaphorical/structural mapping of various everyday tools to our hands and fingers. The basic idea is to virtually transform the hand/fingers into a proper tool (e.g. a fist becoming a hammer head) and gesturally apply it (e.g. hammer in to insert) to and manipulate the target object (e.g. a nail) directly. The main intended objective of HandyTool is to enhance the tool usage experience by one (or one's body part) becoming the tool itself and thereby also possibly improving the task performance. A usability experiment was carried out to assess the projected merits, comparing HandyTool to the case of the as-is emulation of the tool usage (i.e. the tracked hand/finger controlling the tool to apply it to the target object) and to the case of using the controller. Our experiment was not able to show the clear and full potential of HandyTool because of the current performance limitation of the hand/fingers tracking sensor and due to the simplicity in the structural mapping between the tool and hand/fingers. The structural metaphor itself was still shown to be helpful when the controller was used (i.e. stable sensing).",

The historical period of the novel (XVII century) corresponding to the map drawn by Cartaro in 1581. Milan at the time of the author (1785--1873) before the Beruto's master plan that brought down the Spanish walls. And the contemporary city, where the novel itineraries are still recognizable. The time machine -- the core features of the app PS 3.0 -- is a dynamic way to visualize and experience the geo-referenced point of interests of the cultural paths that allow people to discover past in the present in a spatially-situated interaction.",

abstract="e-Coaching approaches have recently received a lot of attention, as technology led healthy ageing solutions depend on empowering older people's motivation. While the beneficial impact of physical activity for older populations is indisputable, this work aims at presenting first designing considerations to be followed if increased adherence to physical activity through an e-coaching system were to be aimed for older adults. The work plan kicks-off on the basis of an existing exergame platform, especially designed and widely tested for older adults (webFitForAll) which is forced to align with notion of behavior change techniques (BCTs) that have been developed for physical activity enhancement. New advances in micro-projector technologies provide extra opportunities for tweaking the accessibility burden while augmenting and blending the real with the coaching environment. Quite reasonably, these are not easy tasks to follow and success depends much on multi-disciplinary approaches encompassing new ideas from co-creation and co-design with the actual users.",

It is built on risk communication and takes action on pilot areas of the three participating countries: Portugal, Iceland, and Italy. The setting up of risk communication strategies in the project stands on the understanding local communities fragility, on their direct engagement, and on a holistic approach to vulnerability. The level of relevance of seismic compared to other hazards, the understanding, the memory of past disasters are indicators that affect the way a risk is perceived and preventive measures are taken. Similarly, the level of education, wealth, exposure to other, social, risks are aggravation parameters in risk computation to be accounted for when we communicate risk. Strategies for risk communication in KnowRISK rely on schools and citizen's engagement, citizen's science activities, tools for raising awareness.",

But while the body's ability to perceive and process information is relatively well understood, touch is only one of the senses of the somatosensory system. Although the communication potential is great, the body is still not represented in the computer interactions we have come to accept in our everyday lives. In this paper, the domain of physical display systems and interactions are surveyed with a view to developing a framework that can offer a more principled and cohesive perspective of this multi-disciplined field of interaction research and development. The paper presents a brief survey of physical displays, and proposes a framework that combines critical parameters from four areas of research to help understand this field of somatosensory-based computer interactions: application, physiology, technology, and psychology.",

abstract="The lack of vision increases the complexity of performing tasks that require spatial representation. People with visual impairment face challenges in establishing positions of obstacles in a physical space. It is hard for them to discern their current location or a direction to go. Thus, any information about the ambient characteristics tends to be relevant to the decision-making process of people who are blind. This process involves the creation of a mental representation of the physical space, which is responsible for storing, retrieving, and decoding information about the environment. A mental representation of the space is a key factor for their Orientation and Mobility (O {\&} M) skills. Several studies have investigated the impact of the use of O {\&} M Virtual Environments in the construction of these mental maps. This paper reports the development of an editor for O {\&} M Virtual Environment focusing on generating indoor spaces simulations, called E3 Editor. Differently, from other studies that provide solutions specific to a given space, E3 Editor allows O {\&} M experts to create their virtual indoor maps and applied them in their practical classes with learners with visual impairment, thus favouring the autonomy of these subjects.",

abstract="In this paper, we propose that a smart approach to city development must seek a continuous and recursive interplay between two levels of codes. On the one hand, computer codes, which rule the development and the functioning of the ubiquitous ICTs infrastructure. On the other hand, normative codes, which govern the practices through which social actors perceive ICTs and decide to exploit them in order to improve their lives. We thus take an exploratory standpoint and investigate to what extent key players in the EU smart cities policy domain are framed according to such a sociotechnical perspective. To this purpose, we first map an online issue network on the topic of smart cities in Europe and then explore the frames that circulate within its core. Our results suggest that, although smart cities are framed sociotechnically, EU key players tend to better converge around technological aspects rather than social ones.",

From the social perspective, Vietnam struggles to reduce the fatal consequences of increasing disasters and accidents in both rural and urban areas year by year. However, people's awareness of safety and appropriate emergency response remains minimal. From the technical perspective, this country is the global highlight with wide internet penetration, quick adoption of new technology, and being one of the biggest and fastest-growing markets for the games industry.

To address this still-unexplored and fragmented design space, we organize a design-oriented workshop that brings together academia and industry. The workshop is informed by a Research through Design approach in which the primary focus is to generate knowledge through designing. Participants design and evaluate ideas on-the-spot in an iterative manner using low-fidelity, life-size, prototyping and role-playing techniques, thereby mimicking an embodied interactive immersive environment. By reflecting on design practices and player experiences, we construct a body of knowledge, built exemplar work and distil best-practices to formulate design strategies for the design of immersive persuasive games.",

abstract="The mobile cloud computing (MCC) is an emerging technology, and its popularity is increasing drastically day by day. Mobile device has been constrained from low battery power, processing capabilities, and limited storage capacity, and MCC is facing several security issues. Users are expecting more computing power and security from mobile devices, in order to support user, the mobile computing integrate with cloud computing (CC) to form a MCC. Computation offloading improves computing features of smartphones (battery power, storage, processing capabilities) as well as user experience with device. In this paper, our main focus is to analyze energy consumption by executing on mobile device or remote cloud, and offloading method and level of partitioning are implemented by exploring different parameters based on frameworks. We summarize comparison between different energy offloading techniques.",

This paper proposed a design concept of multilevel alert takeover information and developed a simulated driving system, and the investigated questionnaires were used to evaluate the takeover performance and user experience. Results show that both levels and channels affect alert efficiency. Multilevel alerts are not able to significantly enhance driving takeover performance but effectively improve user experience. Auditory alert information enables drivers to perceive the risks more quickly, while visual alert information assists drivers to learn about the risk degree more efficiently. It is suggested to add personal experience to motivate the takeover ambitious in further study.",

Should retailers engage customers and enhance affective customer loyalty by co-creating their experiences with them? An appropriate way to answer these questions is to create insight in and to understand customer experience and customer co-creation in retail business. In this chapter, we accomplish this by reviewing extant scientific research on customer experience, co-creation, and retail strategies and propose a conceptual framework for customer co-creation of experiences in retail business. We assert that the purpose of customer experience is to create and deliver value to both customers (via activities related to customer engagement and co-creation) and the retailer. Retailers can increase their competitive advantage by innovating with a focus on customer experience co-creation.",

abstract="Wayfinding difficulties may lead people to avoid places; it also can make them late for important occurrences such as business meetings or flights, which may cause loss of opportunity and money. Additionally, as settings grow in dimension and complexity, emergency evacuation emerges as a key problem, and wayfinding becomes a matter of life and death. Thus, a large concentration of people, with different degrees of familiarity with the building, motivations, and anxieties, should be able to satisfy their needs in a network of paths leading to different destinations, even when, during an emergency, they face doubtful situations created by the incongruence between the architecture and the signage system. In this context, the present paper is focused on a theoretical review on emergency evacuation process and signage systems in order to explore new paradigms on emergency wayfinding into complex building. Considering the evolution of technology in terms of availability, cost and ease of use, this paper discusses the use of traditional and new wayfinding system considering some established theories such as the ``cry wolf'' and the ``learned irrelevance'' theories.",

abstract="This study researched the gamification of in-flight entertainment (IFE). Some previous studies have focused on IFE technology implementation and hardware research; however, few studies have focused on the user's experience of IFE. In this thesis, based on the gamification theory, a somatosensory game was designed to encourage users to take the initiative to relax during long-distance flights. To verify the effectiveness of this design, a prototype with hardware (including a seat with integrated proximity sensors, using Arduino Leonardo's development board) and software (an analog IFE system with game, music, and video capabilities, and a designed somatosensory game) was developed. Two groups were tested: the control group with traditional IFE and the experimental group with an IFE which included elements of gamification. Three sets of data were measured: The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), user experience questionnaire (UEQ), and physical movement duration time. Through analysis of the results, it can be concluded that the IFE with gamification was more novel and stimulating than the traditional IFE. In addition to motivating users to exercise more, the gamification-based IFE was also more effective at reducing anxiety than the traditional IFE.",

Thus, this study aims at showing a possibility to achieve a compelling VBO illusion over a non-human avatar in a virtual environment. The paper describes a within-subjects study exploring if immersed users could achieve a compelling VBO illusion when inhabiting a virtual body of a bat. Test subjects experienced visuo-tactile stimulation of their arms while seeing an object touching their virtual wings. The mapping between the real and virtual touch points varied across three conditions: no offset between the visual and the tactile input, 50{\%} offset, and 70{\%} offset from the tactile input. The results revealed variations in the degree of experienced VBO across the conditions. The illusion was broken in the absence of visuo-tactile stimulation.",

The position of hand in current frame is estimated based on its position in previous frames. At the estimated hand position, a square region of interest (ROI) is considered to search for exact location of hand indicator. We also devised a modified full search (FS) algorithm to apply on entire frame. Efficiency of the algorithm is evaluated based on hand indicator detection rate with respect to frame rate and distance between the camera and projection surface. Performance comparison with other algorithms using FS on entire frame or fixed size ROI shows that implementation of the proposed algorithm significantly improves real-time performance by increasing accuracy and reducing computational time.",

abstract="Prospective memory (PM) is defined be the capacity to remember to realize an intended action in the future. This is a very important cognitive function that permit to maximize autonomy in everyday life. Unfortunately, few assessment tool, valid, reliable and ecological is accessible for clinicians. To obtain a verisimilar and ecologically prospective memory assessment tool, virtual reality seems to be a promising way. A specific and sensible tool could help the clinician to detect subtle changes in the cognition of the elderly and, ideally detect pathological aging soon before the beginning of decline. Because older adults are not really at ease with technology, these (dis)abilities could be confounded with cognitive inefficacy and lead to false positives diagnostics. To avoid this, the psychometrician must consider the impact of human-computer interfaces (HMI) on cognition. This paper present three experiments that show the impact of HMI on stress, capacity to achieve a task and on cognitive load. The first pilot study shown that a ``heavy to use'' HMI generated stress and difficulty to achieve the task with healthy adults. The second pilot study revealed that VMT-2 is judged moderately challenging cognitively and it seems to be more for older participants. The third pilot study shown that a complex virtual environment (in terms of navigation and interaction) is more cognitively challenging than a simple virtual environment for older peoples compared to young participants. These results indicated the importance of considering HMI as a potential variable that could create bias in the cognitive measurement.",

abstract="We present a method to generate a textured 3D model of architecture with a structure of multiple floors and depth layers from image collections. Images are usually used to reconstruct 3D point cloud or analyze facade structure. However, it is still a challenging problem to deal with architecture with depth-layer structure. For example, planar walls and curved roofs appear alternately, front and back layers occlude each other with different depth values, similar materials, and irregular boundaries. A statistic-based top-bottom segmentation algorithm is proposed to divide the 3D point cloud generated by structure-from-motion (SFM) method into different floors. And for each floor with depth layers, a repetition based depth-layer decomposition algorithm based on parallax-shift is proposed to separate the front and back layers, especially for the irregular boundaries. Finally, architecture components are modeled to construct a textured 3D model utilizing the extracting parameters from the segmentation results. Our system has the distinct advantage of producing realistic 3D architecture models with accurate depth information between front and back layers, which is demonstrated by multiple examples in the paper.",

abstract="Cloudlet is introduced to decrease the distance between Main Cloud and mobile users, which directly helps to decrease the latency during game video transmission from the Cloud to mobile users. In this proposed work, a Pre-Stored Cloudlet is introduced. Pre-stored Cloudlet is where the Cloudlet is pre-stored with encoded game videos in it transmitted from the Main Cloud. The main drawbacks of the existing Mobile Cloud Gaming (MCG) are long distances between the Cloud and mobile users, strongly dependent on network, it consumes high bandwidth and causes latency. We proposed a system architecture to overcome the existing problem in MCG by introducing Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc mobile network into the architecture of MCG. Ad Hoc mobile network is formed within the range of Pre-Stored Cloudlets to enable the users to get the pre-rendered game videos from the nearby users. The proposed system has THREE main layers; Cloud, Cloudlet and mobile users and the video transmission is expected to happen between these layers aided with WiMax and WiFi connection. The architecture is implemented through simulation and it is simulated to find the Response Delay which consist of Network Delay, Processing Delay, and Playout Delay. Based on the simulation results obtained, it shows that the introduction of Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc environment has helped to decrease the latency in game video transmission.",

abstract="This study aims to empirically investigate a conceptual model that is nested in a behaviorism paradigm. The model posits that consumer videogame engagement is triggered through the playful-consumption experience of a digital game. To validate the model, this study collected data from 460 teen videogame users which were subsequently analyzed on using 442 valid cases. WarpPLS 5.0 was used to analyze the PLS-SEM analysis. The results of measurement model for playful-consumption experience and consumer videogame engagement were sound and revealed a higher-order formative construct. Moreover, the findings of the structural model showed that playful-consumption experience has a significant positive influence on consumer videogame engagement. This study is unique in the field of digital games and consumer behavior studies because the study has empirically investigated the impact of playful-consumption experience on predicting consumer videogame engagement.",

abstract="Digital games struggle to blend compelling narrative with interactivity. For example, computer role-playing games (CRPGs) allow players the freedom to explore an open world, yet limit their interaction with the world's inhabitants to selecting from pre-determined dialogue choices. In this paper, we explore how players behave when truly free-form dialogue with non-player characters (NPCs) is supported. In the novel Persiflage game, players converse with NPCs using speech. NPCs are in turn voiced by a human, allowing truly free-form conversation. Through a study of five groups playing the game, we show how players converse, interact, and play using natural language.",

abstract="With the development of society, cars have become indispensable means of our daily transportation. Nowadays,researchers in industrial and academic areas are paying more attention to vehicle safety. This paper focuses on automotive head-up display technology in lane changing scenario. We use research, observation and interviews to analyze the relationship between environment, mentality and behaviors in lane changing scenario. We find that once the unfriendly environment stimulates the drivers, they will make the stress response. If the person does not effectively respond to the environmental stimulation, then he may regard the stimulation as a threat, resulting in anger, fear, anxiety and other emotional responses. These negative emotions will have constraints on people's behavior such as insufficient coping ability. Based on this, we put forward the key points in HUD interaction design. One is the efficient information organization and the other one is good interface design.",

abstract="Virtual reality technology allows designing of immersive virtual environment that might be used for diagnostics and treatment of persons with minor sexual preference that is ego-dystonic or is perceived as dangerous to society. We do operate with the theoretical framework that is based on sexual motivational system, which we reintroduce. The eye tracking, electroencephalography and galvanic skin response in combination with phalopletysmography -- the change of penile tumescence in male users are data to be collected to distinguish between sexual arousal and stress. The bio-cybernetic loop will consist of combination of positive and negative feedback loop to diverge the scenario. The biofeedback training should allow us to shape the preference by employing biofeedback training of suppression of the arousal to previously created scenario. This procedure might allow better diagnostics and treatment. Although we have in mind individualization of scenario creates problems in comparison during diagnostic phase, and is more important in case of future therapy. The resulting adaptable GNU software will be available to partner and other interested research centers.",

pages="398--405",
abstract="The aim of this paper is to design a history tool for a 3D virtual environment system using hand interaction. This system would require a new history tool because it creates a different user experience from existing 2D applications. We discuss two challenges for designing the history tool: user needs and interfaces. First, we explore the user needs for a history tool, assuming that the characters' intent to return to the past in time-travel films is analogous to the reasons for changing previous commands using a history tool in a 3D environment system. We analyze time-travel films and then define three design concepts of a history tool. Second, we ideate possible interfaces for a history tool considering hand-based object manipulation. We present the interface types using hands, other body parts, and an additional device. We also discuss the opportunities and constraints of each type. Combining these two discussions, we propose ten design ideas for a history tool in a 3D virtual environment system that provides hand-based interaction. The results of the pilot survey suggest that the history tool design concepts derived from time-travel films would be relevant to the history tool in 3D virtual environment systems.",

abstract="Upon doing research in the realm of physical disability, a common occurrence that was found was people missing the ability to take part in passions they had when they were without any disability. Two areas that were targeted in particular were those affected by paralysis by unnatural causes and those dealing with multiple sclerosis. Accounts of paralysis stem from injuries such as car accidents or sports injuries, while multiple sclerosis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the protective covering of the nerves. In order to find solutions to these lost abilities we attempted to find a way allow people to play music again. The research presented in this paper describes an interactive virtual drumming environment for people who do not have the use of their arms and it also contains a visual representation of the drum rhythms for people who are not able to hear. Players play the drums by moving their head and the audio is played through speakers and through a DMX lighting system. Twenty-five people played the virtual drums and their feedback was recorded and used to make suggestions about improvements.",
