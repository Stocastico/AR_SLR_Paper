abstract="The present research investigates the state-of-the-art concerning virtual and augmented reality lab environments, in science teaching and learning. Both environments are suggested as most appropriate for science education. The study explores the extent to which research has progressed concerning these new tools, while focusing on the extent to which actual educational trials in science classrooms have been completed. To this effect, 19 research papers were identified and reviewed. Conclusions are drawn as regards the effectiveness of these two lab environment types as a function of the age of students, today. The creation of educational VR and AR that resembles reality so closely that it is hard to differentiate between virtual, augmented, and real, thus creating a unified continuum, seems to finally be within our grasp, yet further research is needed as to their optimum use.",

abstract="It is commonly said that Augmented Reality opens new perspectives for training. Today, it is unlikely that the audit objectives will be met. One of the major criticisms of traditional computing is that the digital world of the computer is too disconnected from the real world in which users evolve. Mixed Reality (RM) focuses on interactive systems in which real objects and computer data are coherently merged. However, integrating these new tools into the existing learning processes remains complex, due to the technological aspects and the data continuum to be implemented, through the identification of use cases and the associated gains and by the diversity actors and experts to involve in this process: the expert of the main field, the designer and the IT developer. In this paper we aim to develop an augmented reality application by following a developing process that will led to the planned results. The proposed application will be dictated for learners in higher education context, especially newbies that will practice their first experiment in the laboratory e.g. ``biology, chemistry'' by giving them an interactive environment to understand the safety procedure followed during experiments in laboratories.",

abstract="Evermore widespread ``flipped classroom'' learning model is associated with increased independence of learning. The problem is the independence of learning math by students with visual impairments, especially the blind. Mathematical content includes spatial objects such as formulas and graphics, inaccessible to blind students and hardly accessible to low vision students. They prevent independent learning. The article presents a method that increases students' independence in recognising mathematical content in textbooks and worksheets. The method consists in introducing into the document elements of Augmented Reality (AR), that is texts and sounds extending information about the mathematical objects encountered in the content, beyond the information provided by WCAG guidelines and recommendations of the WAI-ARIA standard under development by the W3C consortium. Access to AR elements is gained through multi-sensual User Interface - hearing, the touch of a braille display, touch screen and touch gestures. The method was developed in cooperation with students with visual impairment and math teachers. It is currently undergoing valorisation in Poland, the Netherlands and Ireland.",

Through an analysis in a sample of children aged between 3 to 5 years, the advantages, disadvantages that the RA has over them in their cognitive advances with the experience of the objects are identified. Observation, experimental and inductive methods were used, as a result of the project, it was found that children love learning in a more practical, playful and positive way. The use of AR serves to motivate them and encourage them to learn in a meaningful, creative and animated way so that they can grasp and adopt learning as part of their environment.

abstract="Autism is a severe disorder affecting 1 in 160 children globally. Autism comprises of several development disabilities such as social, communicational and behavioural challenges. Children being diagnosed by the autism mainly face a hard time studying curriculum in inclusive classrooms based on their IQ level and the autism levels. Although, different strategies and learning teaching tools are available to support autistic children, only few systems aid them in learning efficiently, and are not highly interactive. Thus, the proposed Intelligent Education System primarily focuses on providing interactive learning experience to the autistic children with IQ level >50{\%} and efficient teaching assistance to their tutors using augmented reality and machine learning in both English and Arabic The capability of the education system to perform an action, allows the autistic child to interact with the playable sand and gain interest. In learning stage, once the child scribbles on the sandbox, Kinect 3D camera captures and recognizes the drawn image. After the refinement and recognition of the image using OpenCV and classification model, the stored set of real world object are projected on the canvas. Besides, a webcam captures the facial expression of the child, and emotion detection algorithm determines the reaction of the child. Based on the child's emotion, the current object is projected and pronounced three times to enforce better learning. Once the instructor chooses the language and character to be taught using the developed mobile application, the system displays it over the sandbox and further three objects that starts with the particular character are pronounced and projected. The system is tested rigorously with large set of users, and the results prove the efficiency of the system and happiness of the autistic children in better learning.",

abstract="This work focuses on the Augmented Reality trying to improve students' interaction and participation in the educational dialogue, preventing the drop out, tested with university mathematics courses. Students often have difficulties on some topics related to the transition between different representations, within the same representations and language, for example when dealing with the study of two-variable functions, but also about the exact differential forms and the identification of the domain to integrate a function of several variables. These difficulties lead to a decrease in interaction and participation, and sometimes to dropping out of the course. Augmented Reality has been used to overcome some of these difficulties, also with the use of some technological tools (3D glasses, computers, tablets) and innovative methodologies. In order to evaluate the impact of this approach on students' interaction and participation, an experimentation with an e-learning platform based on Augmented Reality was carried out evaluating some affective and interaction parameters, computed through a Fuzzy Cognitive Map.",

abstract="Teaching introductory computer science is gradually shifting from learning a computer programming language towards acquiring more generic computational thinking skills. At the same time, more emphasis is placed nowadays in natural and playful approaches that can potentially increase student motivation and engagement. One promising such approach is the combination of tangible elements with augmented reality technology, where the instructions can be given in the real world by manipulating physical elements, and the output is presented in a digitally enhanced space. Despite its potential, this approach has not yet been evaluated in formal educational settings. In this paper we present the results from a preliminary study in an elementary school that compared a tangible AR game with the same game in an unplugged version, to examine the effect of the interface on student motivation, effectiveness and teaching practice. The results indicate that a tangible AR approach can improve the engagement and collaboration of students in classroom activities and affects the role of the instructor compared to unplugged activities. The paper concludes with a number of open issues that need to be further studied.",

abstract="In recent years the development of technologies which enhance the perceptual experience of the physical environment has progressed significantly. Along with this advancement rose also the curiosity and acceptance of people toward interacting with computer-generated elements and nowadays this interesting concept called Augmented Reality (AR) is starting to be present in nearly every aspect of humans life. Although AR is predominantly known for its entertainment, gaming character, within the time it has transformed into a publicly available, scalable tool which can be used in a more serious context. In 2015, a collaboration between Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab, Changing Places Group, and the German city of Hamburg introduced a practical use of AR in urban planning. This case study presents a project Finding Places (FP) - an idea of applying games into an AR-assisted participatory method in regard to solving a complex, sensible urban challenge, resulted in creating a unique decision-making tool with entertaining, which may have a chance to grow into a consequent, urban development practice. First of all, it introduces the reader with the subject of moderation methods of urban participatory events, applied game, and the Geospatial AR (GeoAR) through. Secondly, through case's study analysis and following discussion examine the efficiency and usability aspects of such aided planning approach. The goal of this work is to show the possibilities that instruments like the GeoAR could give in the context of urban planning and to encourage diverse city stakeholders to experiment with innovative, resource-saving, digital tools.",

In this paper, we present a first design of a virtual and interactive paper tiger using augmented reality (AR), and perform an evaluation of the developed prototype. We evaluated the prototype on twenty-seven pilot students at the Lund University School of Aviation (LUSA), to explore the possibilities and technical advantages that AR can offer, in particular the procedure that is performed before takeoff. The prototype got positive results on perceived workload, and in remembering the flow pattern. The main contribution of this paper is to elucidate knowledge about the value of using AR for training pilot students.",

abstract="With the development of the augmented reality technology and the popularisation of smartphones, the application of augmented reality based on mobile devices demonstrates an optimistic development prospect. The current development of mobile augmented reality is mainly technology-oriented, mostly emphasises on technology advancement as a basis of measure while placing insufficient emphasis upon user experience. User-centric design is increasingly important in the design of mobile applications. As it is crucial to quantify and evaluate user experiences of AR application to gain insight in pivotal areas for future development, which this research proposes that the application of the Delphi-AHP method is capable of identifying those areas via five first-level indicators and 20 second-level indicators. This method is tested and verified with six model display applications, which discovered the most important first-level indicators to affect user experience is a system's functionality and its display.",

abstract="Following the rapid development of high-technology industries, digital applications have been applied in various technologies, bringing people a whole new daily living experience. Interactive technology has led to breakthrough innovations. Application of augmented reality (AR), in addition to people's approaches to interact with the physical world, has changed industry owners' methods in designing products. This reveals the criticality of designing products with AR technology and new forms of interactions. This study investigated the current status regarding the cultural and creative products in consumer markets and the effectiveness of incorporating AR technology into cultural and creative product design courses. Data were analyzed to clarify said effectiveness and confirm the feasibility of AR technology in cultural and creative product design. A survey was performed on the cultural and creative products in the National Palace Museum located in Taipei and those designed by university students majoring in design to explore the effect of AR technology employed in cultural and creative product design on consumers' review of and purchase intentions for the products. The following conclusion was reached: (1) The scale constructed to evaluate the cultural and creative products designed using AR technology was feasible. (2) AR technology positively affected participants' review of and purchase intentions for cultural and creative products. (3) The products created by students according to the teaching method employed exhibited business value of high interactivity. Future cultural and creative product design courses can employ AR technology in their principles and practices in training innovative talents that satisfy the market demand. The design principles developed thereof can also serve as a reference for industry owners in designing cultural and creative products.",

abstract="The project ``Tales on Rails'' describes the research and development of an augmented reality game that can be played on trains with smartphones. The project addresses tourism changes in the digital age; the ubiquitous use of smartphones alters a tourist's travel experience, from accessing timetables to conveying cultural and historic information or transforming traditional souvenirs. ``Tales on Rails'' tested a smartphone application allowing tourists to play a game about a crime story on the route between the cities of Lucerne and Interlaken, which is operated by the Swiss railways company zb Zentralbahn AG. The game directly references the environment outside the train on this route as well as cultural themes about the region. The game's progress is linked to the position of the train, successively unlocking its content on the route. The game is tailored for use by 20 to 30-year-old leisure travellers, and optimized for a group experience in which two to four players collaborate on solving the game; thus, group dynamics during the gaming experience could be investigated. The game features a technologically ambitious program with augmented reality game elements, while minimizing negative impacts on playability by environmental influences such as seasonal and weather conditions. The technical complexity of the concept could be expanded in future iterations. The project ``Tales on Rails'' was released in July 2019 as fully functional game application in the Google Play Store and the Apple Store.",

abstract="Short-term qualification for temporary workers is a constant challenge for manufacturing companies. Cycle times of machines often have to be reduced for training processes, which demands time and financial resources. This increases the need for near-the-job trainings without manipulating cycle times of the machine. Digital visualization tools using Mixed Reality (MR) promise opportunities for application-oriented practical training. However, especially for industrial applications, where procedural knowledge has to be transferred, it is not clear which MR technology should be used for which purpose. In order to answer this question, this paper examines the underlying MR-features of the technology. In an experimental setting, the same virtual training for the assembly of a pneumatic cylinder is examined with an augmented reality/augmented virtuality (AR/AV) based application in comparison to a virtual reality (VR) based application. Based on the carried out study, there are significant differences in the evaluation of the system usability, but no differences in the evaluation of the ergonomics and the perceived task load during the task. Out of 16 test persons, 14 would choose the VR system in the final analysis. The results are discussed in the paper and recommendations for the design of MR based systems in an industrial context are given.",

This paper is intended to show an initial version, where were validated its completeness, suitability, ease of use, and ease of learning, through expert judgment. For this work, a substantial body of research was consolidated using the multi-cycle action research methodology with a three-cycle fork: conceptual, methodological, and evaluation. According to the results, it can be said that the guidelines are complete, easy to learn, moderately usable and moderately suitable; it determines that there is a need to continue improving their description in such a way that they can adequately satisfy the purpose for which they were created, however, we believe that the resulting guidelines represent a good contribution to the usability engineering knowledge field in this context.",

We discuss the initial design of MRCAT and iteration after a study ({\$}{\$}N = 14{\$}{\$}) to evaluate users' abilities to craft AR applications with MRCAT and with a 2D prototyping tool. We contextualize our system in a case study of museum exhibit development, identifying how existing ideation and prototyping workflows could be bolstered with the approach offered by MRCAT.

abstract="In clinical practice, medical imaging technologies, like computed tomography, have become an important and routinely used technique for diagnosis. Advanced 3D visualization techniques of this data, e.g. by using volume rendering, provide doctors a better spatial understanding for reviewing complex anatomy. There already exist sophisticated programs for the visualization of medical imaging data, however, they are usually limited to exactly this topic and can be hardly extended to new functionality; for instance, multi-user support, especially when considering immersive VR interfaces like tracked HMDs and natural user interfaces, can provide the doctors an easier, more immersive access to the information and support collaborative discussions with remote colleagues. We present an easy-to-use and expandable system for volumetric medical image visualization with support for multi-user VR interactions. The main idea is to combine a state-of-the-art open-source game engine, the Unreal Engine 4, with a new volume renderer. The underlying game engine basis guarantees the extensibility and allows for easy adaption of our system to new hardware and software developments. In our example application, remote users can meet in a shared virtual environment and view, manipulate and discuss the volume-rendered data in real-time. Our new volume renderer for the Unreal Engine is capable of real-time performance, as well as, high-quality visualization.",

The Water Cycle in Nature applications is focused on precipitation formation and the relevant physics phenomena, such as vaporization, condensation and evaporation. This application contains 3D immersive computer-based virtual reality and virtual laboratory simulations. As part of this pilot, two classes were involved, one control class of 29 boys which were taught the educational content in a teacher-based approach lesson, and one experimental class of 29 boys which interacted with the NEWTON project application. Following the knowledge pre and post-tests, the control class was also exposed to the TEL Water Cycle in Nature application, in order to assess and compare the learner experience and satisfaction between the control class and the experimental class. Detailed analysis of the learner experience and learner satisfaction and comparison between the two participating classes is performed in this extended paper. The TEL application's usability and benefits in terms of knowledge gain were also evaluated. The obtained results show good outcomes in usability and learner experience for both classes, with the control class reporting slightly better results. Another notable fact was noticed in the knowledge gain analysis between the two approaches, showing that students benefited more in learning outcomes when interacting with a teacher. It has been shown that the excitement of the experimental group students towards the game might have created a barrier in terms of learning improvement and the NEWTON application will serve better as a revision tool under the supervision and guidance of the teacher and a support tool for the teacher.",

We document how these designs are in a tension between allowing game-based interactions, and the didactic communication about facts in the exhibition. We study the implemented solutions based on qualitative interviews with visitors, and with quantitative data from the backend game analytics of the installations. From triangulating these data sets we show how attempts to deliver purely fact-based information through didactic design elements fail to succeed in engaging the visitors, while stealth learning sparks enlightenment about the subject matter. Our results suggest that this is true both in cases in which users fully understand and play through the intended interactions, as well as when more negotiated interpretations of the digital installations are performed. From this our contribution are guiding principles for the balance, between experience and enlightenment in gamified exhibition designs.",

abstract="Human behavior is considered to be the weakest link in the field of cybersecurity. Despite the development of a wide range of Augmented Reality (AR) applications in various domains, no AR application is available to educate users and increase their awareness of cybersecurity issues. Thus, we developed a game based on AR techniques as an Android app called CybAR. Since there have been few acceptance studies in the field of AR, it was particularly important to identify the factors that affect user acceptance of AR technology. This paper aims to identify whether gamification features influence users' acceptance of the CybAR app and increase their cybersecurity awareness. The predictors of CybAR app usage were derived from the extended unified theory of acceptance and usage of technology (UTAUT2) with the addition of the gamification factor. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of a study addressing the impact of gamification features on acceptance of the CybAR game. The theoretical model was tested in a quantitative study using structural equation modelling, conducted in Australia, with 95 Macquarie University students. The findings indicate that there is a significant relationship between gamification factors and behavioural intention to use the CybAR app and actual use of the CybAR app.",

abstract="Young children as well as children with special educational needs learn from their environment with social, emotional and physical stimuli. In this context, educational resources and teaching strategies play a main role for them in order to understand the new information. This paper describes the experience of building hybrid interfaces that combine technology with traditional educational resources. A total of 60 teachers divided in two groups completed some tasks which consisted of generating new educative resources with tecnology. Through Design Thinking methodology, teachers designed three hybrid interfaces: 1. Interactive books, combining traditional fairy tales books with mobile devices, where QR codes and NFC tags give life to the stories; 2. Educational Board Games, where augmented reality markers give an extra information to the players; 3. Tangible educational resources, which integrate Makey-Makey device and Scratch with fruit, clay, aluminum foil or water to build laboratory.",

Some students prefer to learn by seeing, hearing, reflecting, acting or reasoning logically while others prefer to learn by visualizing, drawing analogies and building mathematical models. Traditionally, Engineering education has focused on content-based or design-based approaches that allowed students to develop problem solving skills. Use of technology for instructional purposes or communication has not been very effective in Sri Lankan universities in the past. This research is to find out how we can improve Sri Lankan Engineering students' engagement in studies via collaborative learning by using mobile technology. In addition, research will compare the effectiveness of different online collaborative learning methodologies that use mobile based and web-based learning and teaching platforms in Sri Lanka.",

A combination of interviews, emails, questions and a survey methodology was used to understand how the AR set up is selected with the users, where these technologies are being employed, the strengths and limitations, and where there is continued development with partners to mature. The iterative process enabled the mapping of user expectations and values to the technology characterisitcs to select the AR technology for a specific task. The Task Technology Fit (TTF) model was used to explain the theory for how user expectations and technology characteristics can be used to determine fit especially where the technology is still maturing.",

abstract="Augmented Reality (AR) is an emerging technology that is gaining in popularity as it becomes more affordable. AR applications superimpose computerized objects on top of the users' physical world. Through the use of mobile devices or AR glasses, users can see their physical environment around them as well as the digital artifacts. AR has been touted as the next technology to replace our current smartphone and desktop experiences for everyday activities. For example, online shopping, examination of health information, interior decorating, and family communication are activities that have the potential to be enhanced by AR. Older adults, in particular, stand to benefit from this technology. This paper discusses the usability and user experience (UX) of AR applications among older adults. In addition, it explains the heuristics that have been suggested for AR applications and how they can be applied to older adult populations. Such heuristics allow providers of AR solutions to more quickly and reliably assess usability and UX, which in turn facilitates informed iterative design/development, resulting in more satisfying, efficient, and effective solutions.",

abstract="A nation's cultural heritage is of great importance both for indigenous people as well as for foreigners as it is a nation's contribution to humanity and global civilization. As the spark to discover that treasure has ignited and travelling around the world has become much easier, it is necessary to enhance the way that monuments are exhibited and communicated. Current technology offers the capability to alter the way that information is provided and represented. Augmented reality (AR) is the most characteristic example as it surpasses the limits that exist in other media offering a unique experience to the user. A great challenge for AR is to shed a new light on monuments, especially in cities like Athens, filled with historical monuments. In this paper we describe the methodology that was followed in order to create an AR application that will provide users with a virtual time leap experience in the past depicting the monument's history in its social context. Thus, the issues emerging during the development of an AR app is discussed, as well as solutions to common problems regarding its utilization in outdoors space. Aiming to shed light on its importance throughout the centuries, an interdisciplinary research has been conducted combining fields like architecture and psychology in order to inform and in parallel, arouse emotions to visitors and thus, intensify the experience. Supporting that, user experience has been enhanced following a UI/UX approach, which provides the appropriate tools between easy-to-use and following a narrative.",

Alzheimer's brain have impact on affecting brain, include loss of memory, difficulty in thinking, language and solving problems symptoms. Heart issues, depression, diabetes and high blood pressure pose a higher risk of causing Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's disease in the brain proteins build up to form structures known as plaques, which are the abnormal clumps in the brain, and tangles which are the bundles of fibbers in the brain. This leads to loss of brain tissue, nerve cells connections and lead to death of nerve cells. In their brain there is a shortage of chemicals. These chemical messengers around the brain help to transmit signals whose shortage causes the signals do not transmit effectively. The above symptoms were visualized as AR (Augmented Reality) model to assist doctors for medical analysis. Augmented Reality act as a extremity tool for findings, supporting and analyse the Alzheimer's Disease. Understanding the AR brain model enhance the analysis of the brain with the technical exploration of tracking, visualization technology layer by layer level, integrated feedback about different parts of the brain function which plays a major role in clinical evaluation to treat the Alzheimer's disease. Microglia are a type of cell that initiate immune responses in the brain and spinal cord. When AD is present, microglia interpret the beta-amyloid plaque as cell injury.

The traditional editorial design has had to adapt to the new digital media composition, where multimedia audiovisual elements unthinkable a few years ago need to be integrated. The participation of the reader, as an external observer who only receives information through texts and images, now has new scenarios in which he can actively participate and decide what will come to his hands. In this study, a work methodology based on UxD User Experience Design is presented, in which will generate the editorial design of an educational book on environmental issues, which includes augmented reality for children from 6 to 8 years of age. The aim of this study is to know if an editorial product with augmented reality and developed from the user experience design can improve meaningful learning in a playful and active way. For its development, a composition model based on the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio will be used. Additionally, its graphic composition will be guided by the Massimo Vignelli canon and will be complemented by the reticular model of Beth Tondreau. The augmented reality markers position will also be based on the composition model previously mentioned, which will allow keeping the attention of the reader in the printed document and in the augmented reality animations. The user experience design will be applied with teachers, parents and students from 4 schools in Quito and Ambato. Once the production is completed, the impact on teaching-learning process will be evaluated with a control and a test group, and the methodology with which they will work in the classroom with the educational material developed will be defined. At the end of the study, copies of the book will be delivered to the participating schools of this research for its implementation.",

abstract="Education is changing rapidly, so emerging technologies are being used to improve this process. One of these technologies is the Virtual Reality (VR), whose field of action is increasingly broad, so it has been incorporating new methods in teaching having a great positive impact in recent years, but the applicability in the area of communication is minimal. Seeing the challenges faced by the Ministry of Education in the development of reading skills and strengthening the capabilities of students in our country. In the this research a new alternative is proposed, to improve the beginnings of the habit of reading in students of second grade of Elementary School having to use of a mobile application with VR named Diverticuentos that generates scenes of the readings in 360{\textdegree} besides being connected to a databases like firebase that allows us to see the progress of each student verifying that it is possible to integrate this new technology in the sessions and to generate a beginning of habit of reading of the students.",

A field experiment was conducted to investigate the performance and experience of young and older adults when they used two common functions (virtual navigator and auxiliary map) of AR-based navigation aid. Success rate, navigation error and speed variation were measured. A total of 28 younger adults and older adults participated in this experiment. The results showed that almost all participants could complete navigation tasks successfully. Presenting virtual navigator and auxiliary map would result in more navigation errors for participants. In addition, the effect of virtual navigator on the navigation error was related to road condition. Presenting virtual navigator would decrease the navigation error in simple road condition and increase navigation error in complex road condition. Furthermore, older adults preferred AR-based navigation aid than young adults. Finally, 11 usability problems were collected in this study.",

Therefore, a contingency plan was defined, with a strategic variation, participating in events and expositions with big audience; a monographic hall of the architecture professional environment and an international exposition focused on video games. We were able to validate SG usefulness by testing the new use of HMD (Head Mounted Display) in great public gatherings and also a new interaction methodology through touch screens joined with screenings of great size in a semi immersive environment. By this means the user designs and modifies the scene in third person, navigating through it with the help of a joystick or using HMD as an alternative. The result of the screening has proven to be robust and stable along the time, it is accessible to all types of users and very encouraging. With this installation and the participation of the citizens in our project has increase exponentially, allowing us to validate the agility of itself by having different people playing simultaneously with it and taking data by automatically taking screen captures.",

abstract="Augmented and virtual reality in combination with robotics offers unique design opportunities centered around novel human machine collaboration. The coordination of these tools allows for unique modes of collaborative design, sensory stimulation and strategic deception. In this paper, we outline the components and calibration of a collaborative environment which coordinates industrial robotics, mobile augmented reality, and virtual reality. This technical setup allows for multiple modes of experimentation, encouraging reflection on the larger domain of human-robotic collaboration. As such, this work facilitates the definition of four discrete modes of robotic collaboration: Stop-Gap Collaboration, Manual-Assist Collaboration, Creative Collaboration, and Environmental Collaboration. Stop-Gap Collaboration uses humans to bridge technical gaps in automated systems. Manual-Assist Collaboration uses digital tools to augment the human execution of technical tasks. Creative Collaboration prioritizes creative expression, while Environmental Collaboration considers humans as agents in occupied and continuously evolving robotic environments. As robotics gains prominence in design and manufacturing, it becomes increasingly important to examine the role of human beings in partially automated workflows---prioritizing creativity and environmental adaptivity in design applications.",

abstract="Substantial advances in technology have consistently been developed alongside new methods of interaction. With the recent advances in the areas of both augmented and virtual reality (AR, VR), there exists a strong need to explore what new interaction paradigms should be implemented to ensure the best possible user experience for those engaging with these technologies. With VR having far more definition in this space then AR, the focus of this research is on defining types of functionality best suited for a product that can assist its user in better navigating an AR-based experience. Research areas were selected based upon the information most relevant to AR-wearable products, including: use-cases, wearable technology, and virtual reality. Each of these subjects occupied a distinct phase of research (1--3). Insight gained from the present study could serve as a useful guide for the design of a concept peripheral product with the goal of improving the user experience of those unfamiliar with AR systems. Results showed that there is certainly a potential opportunity for an AR product in the right environment, that the general public is ready and willing to adopt wearable technology so long as it supplies enough functionality to justify its use, and that adopting affordances of technology that users are familiar with such as touch screens and haptic vibrations greatly improves the comfort and ease of use of AR products.",

The goal is not only to observe how social interactions are affected by the manipulation of augmented artifacts, but also to observe how the sounds and manipulations affect psycho-sociological [1] changes towards more collaborative social relations during the processes of participatory sense-making [2].

Therefore, this paper describes an exploratory survey study that examined U.S. college and university students' responses to collect data about current mobile technology use. Novel to this study, gaining a clearer picture of mobile technology from students, educators and researchers can better apply m-learning to target desired learning behaviors and outcomes. Results suggest students have access to many mobile devices, however, they tend to be very selective in what device they choose to use for their learning. The findings indicate that their use of mobile technology is highly dependent upon the characteristics of the learning activity they are engaging in, and the subject matter.

abstract="Given the sometimes disparate findings and the increasing application of AR in both training and operations, as well as increased affordability and availability, it is important for researchers, user interface and user experience (UI/UX) designers, and AR technology developers to understand the factors that impact the utility of AR. To increase the potential for realizing the full benefit of AR, adequately detailing the interrelated factors that drive outcomes of different AR usage schemes is imperative. A systematic approach to understanding influential factors, parameters, and the nature of the influence on performance provides the foundation for developing AR usage protocols and design principles, which currently are few. Toward this end, this work presents a theoretical model of factors impacting performance with AR systems. The framework of factors, including task, human, and environmental factors, conceptualizes the concept of ``AR Receptivity'', which aims to characterize the degree to which the application of AR usage is receptive to the technology design and capabilities. The discussion begins with a brief overview of research efforts laying the foundation for the model's development and moves to a review of receptivity as a concept of technology suitability. This work provides details on the model and factor components, concluding with implications for application of AR in both the training and operational settings.",

abstract="Technologies of Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) are increasingly applied in urban construction and smart cities. As one of the high fidelity revivification methods, the purpose of these applications is to provide a better immerse experience over the combination of realistic and virtual interactions. Numerous methods and models are adopted to simulate real life scenarios. Regularly, first-person perspective (1PP) is a spontaneous way to revive reality virtually, and this is also what most manufacturers do. In a different way, we tend to verify the feasibility of a new perspective for VR, AR or MR: a third-person perspective (3PP) with multiple Point of View (PoV) from different fixed cameras. We implemented an immersive AR environment for users to control or view themselves in a third person perspective. They are able to switch among different perspectives in different angles, including a first-person view. We developed a simple game based on this environment and conducted user study with this implementation. The result shows that people will generally be intrigued and willing to pay for a new MR experience (like 3PP) if the process is effortless and pleasurable. The most welcomed thing is the ability to switch perspectives during a VR or AR experience. This environment can be extended to real world services such as interviewing, dating and picnic, etc. or future smart cities services that use VR and AR, such as VR traffic management, VR communities empathetic planning and AR navigation, etc.",

However, some people have difficulties in performing these activities, for example, in the case of autism. High-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a chronic, life long condition characterized by social communication and social interaction deficits during the educational process. The development of computational tools, that combine hardware and software, helps to overcome these difficulties. This paper shows the development and implementation of an adaptive robotic platform that aimed to construct robots to establish a communication process with children at an educational level.",

abstract="Interactive tools and immersive technologies make teaching more engaging and complex concepts easier to comprehend are designed to benefit training and education. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations numerically solve Newton's equations of motion for a given set of particles (atoms or molecules). Improvements in computational power and advances in virtual reality (VR) technologies and immersive platforms may in principle allow the visualization of the dynamics of molecular systems allowing the observer to experience first-hand elusive physical concepts such as vapour-liquid transitions, nucleation, solidification, diffusion, etc. Typical MD implementations involve a relatively large number of particles N = O({\$}{\$}10^4{\$}{\$}104) and the force models imply a pairwise calculation which scales, in case of a Lennard-Jones system, to the order of O({\$}{\$}N^2{\$}{\$}N2) leading to a very large number of integration steps. Hence, modelling such a computational system over CPU along with a GPU intensive virtual reality rendering often limits the system size and also leads to a lower graphical refresh rate. In the model presented in this paper, we have leveraged GPU for both data-parallel MD computation and VR rendering thereby building a robust, fast, accurate and immersive simulation medium. We have generated state-points with respect to the data of real substances such as CO{\$}{\$}{\_}2{\$}{\$}2. In this system the phases of matter viz. solid liquid and gas, and their emergent phase transition can be interactively experienced using an intuitive control panel.",

In this context, the question of acceptance of such a collaboration by human workers is essential for a successful implementation. Augmenting the robot-to-human communication channel with situation-specific and explanatory information might increase the workers' willingness to collaborate with artificial counterparts, as a robot that provides guidance and explanation might be perceived as more cooperative in a social sense. However, the effects of using different augmentation strategies and parameters have not yet been sufficiently explored. This paper examines the usage of augmenting industrial robots involved in shared task environments by conducting an evaluation in a virtual reality (VR) setting. The results provide a first step towards an iterative design process aiming to facilitate and enhance the collaboration between human's and robot's in industrial contexts.",

abstract="In the past 50 years, farm producers have increased use of electronic control systems for controlled environment agriculture in greenhouses and animal production. These systems use environmental sensors to automate environmental management of greenhouses and can lead to significantly larger yields. However, mismanagement of a CEA system can also lead to loss of entire crops. Due to the sensitivity of crops in CEA and potential losses, students are rarely allowed to work directly with CEA systems. In order to increase opportunities for students to interact with CEA systems, an immersive virtual greenhouse simulation was created. Implementing realistic interfaces for physical tasks and for the CEA system provides students with `hands-on' training in the virtual greenhouse. However, there are challenges that limit implementation of physical actions and realistic interfaces in virtual reality. We consider interfaces for three types of interactions: system interactions, physical greenhouse interactions, and interactions with the CEA system. Potential interface designs are presented with a discussion of the benefits and costs associated with each design.",

In many cases, the digital technology performs more than one role: practitioners are using ready-made tools for making interactive works and at the same time writing algorithms to create digital partners with whom they perform. In this kind of creative practice, the technology is often the material of the creative works as well as the means by which they are made. It can enable a wide range of aesthetic qualities as well as facilitate different kinds of experience for both creators and audiences. This is a journey that many artists are taking in the 21st century contemporary digital arts world.

By collaboration, cogs augment human cognitive ability in a human/cog ensemble. This paper introduces six Levels of Cognitive Augmentation to describe the balance of cognitive processing in the human/cog ensemble.

The patients also reported their level of fear on a scale from 0 to 10. The treatment procedure consisted in a VR-based game where the subjects were exposed to the same heights. They had to perform some small quests at various distances from the railing and report the in-game stress level, while biophysical data was recorded. The real-life scenarios have been repeated, with the purpose of assessing the efficiency of the VR treatment plan.",

The participation of users in the evaluation of HCI system development is investigated by means of the design of human work in Cyber-physical production systems, the use of Augmented Reality as a promising new technology in production scenarios, as well as on the example of a serious game-based decision support in urban logistics. The implementation of user-based evaluation studies in the use cases shows that such studies can increase user acceptance of HCI systems in the context of production and logistics.

abstract="In recent years, with the rapid development of big data, cloud computing, and deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI) has returned to the public's field of vision once again and gradually deepened and infiltrated into different areas of our life. In this context, interactive art faces the unprecedented opportunities and challenges. In the past, the process and results of interaction were under the control of the creators, and the audience could only interact with artworks mechanically. Most of these interactive artworks just met the primary demand for the audio-visual effects and the sensory stimulation, which has become a common problem of interactive art. However, developments of AI in the field of human-computer interaction allow artists to go beyond the limitations of the past, thus the interactive process will be more human, intelligent, and diversified. AI involved in artistic creation is undoubtedly the developing trend and the latest direction of future. Nevertheless, interactive art in AI, whose creative mechanism has not been constructed, just begun to rise, and requires theoretical guidance. Therefore, discussing and studying the interactive art creation mechanism in the context of AI will have certain theoretical, practical and social significance. The purpose of this paper is to provide a methodological approach for interactive art creation in the context of AI, and a new creative thinking and direction for art practitioners, theoreticians and scientists. This paper first discusses the core role of AI media in interactive art creation. And then it analyzes the subjectivity and interrelationship between the artists, robots and participants in the process. Finally, it puts forward the basic idea of constructing a new mechanic system of intelligent interactive art creation. In short, this paper builds a new interactive art creation system that takes ``cognition of human-computer symbiosis, innovation supported by intelligent technology, collaboration among creative subjects, and constraints on creative behavior ''as a new methodological approach, in which AI is the core media, artists, robots, and audience are the co-creation subjects.",

Two-person teams (dyads) played the role of commander's staff tasked with planning the most efficient and safest mission route for a squad of soldiers to extract a repository of intelligence documents from the ruins of a building located in enemy territory. Quantitative and qualitative measures of performance were collected. We focused on two performance measures: total mission planning time and mission execution time (the planned route run in a simulated execution mode). Surprisingly, there was a significant decrease in planning time when using the Surface Touch Table. The dyads needed on average 86{\%} more time to plan the mission using the HoloLens. Additionally, this increase in mission planning time associated with the HoloLens did not produce a more optimal mission solution.

Analysis results suggested: a more realistic scene invited unnecessary exploration instead of focused time on task; becoming familiar with the HoloLens spilled over into task time; collaborative and communication difficulties stemmed from the HoloLens being designed as a single-user device.",

abstract="One of the museum's missions is education. Based on the orientation of the National Science and Technology Museum, science and technology knowledge is essential. The exhibition of science and technology is the basis of the museum to promote the activity of science and technology education. In 2018, the National Science and Technology Museum built the exhibit of industrial robots at the smart manufacturing experience zone of power and machines gallery per the 4-year project of the Ministry of Education for achieving a smart museum. The purpose of the exhibit is to deliver the concepts of smart manufacturing and industry 4.0 and to promote innovative technology education. The design concept of the exhibition is an in-depth experience for the knowledge of industrial robots. Through techniques of digital media and interactive applications, the professional subject can be much enjoyable, attractive, and understandable for the public. The exhibit of industrial robots consists of five sections: the definition of robots, the historical development of industrial robots, the mechanical structure, and applications of industrial robots. In this exhibit, thirteen industrial robots, including the types of 6-DOF series robots, SCARA and wafer robot, are applied for the display of products and miniatures, demonstration for various processes as well as experience of interactive devices. In a word, the exhibit is not only the material of technology education but also a successful example for the cooperation between the museum and industrial companies.",

abstract="The contribution suggests reflecting upon participatory mapping of cultural values processes contained in everyday landscapes, particularly fragile environments such as peripheral urban areas. The theme is addressed starting from the reexamination of Politecnico di Milano research experience which focused on the involvement of younger generations in landscape education and enhancement of the widespread cultural heritage processes. From this experimental project, we developed tools and methodologies to support institutions in standardising local heritage education. Within this framework, the participatory mapping tradition becomes an important reference for its subjective and interdisciplinary aspect and ability to represent the community's spatial knowledge, because it offers cues for technological integration in processes for inexperienced users. Mapping used here is a reading, interpreting, communicating and sharing process which involves multiple players and educational frameworks. Drafting such maps combines traditional methodologies and innovative technologies and allows the development of different activities and products including learning tours, visual storytelling, sketches, mind maps, interactive digital maps, Geographic Information Systems, virtual reality environments, interactive digital tourist tours and gamification apps. The availability of these tools allows young citizens to become active players in the knowledge and communication processes, to strengthen their sense of belonging to places, to develop active citizenship, to foster intergenerational and intercultural dialogues, and to protect the cultural landscape as a common good.",

Due to the global financial crisis the funds available to sustain the operations of museums and libraries become difficult not only to obtain them but also to utilized them effectively and efficiently. The operational costs of museums increase over the time due to exhibit maintenance and acquisition costs. This cost is inversely proportional to the revenues that can be generated. Virtual reality, avatar technologies, virtual worlds, holograms, gaming and gamification can offer creative interactivity and unique experiences with low or no cost to the global visitor and introduce new revenue streams. This paper practically integrates the realization of digital cultural strategies and operations within the context of digital humanities economics that can turn museums and libraries from cost centres to profit centres for the benefit of the humanity and the society.",

The system was designed to both entertain and educate the visitors, empowering them to understand how unsustainable behaviours may affect our lives in the future and emphasize the need to take relevant actions for building a more environmentally sustainable world. Augmented Gallery consists of an AR app running on networked smartphones used by visitors. The app displays, at visual and auditory level, scenes representing various healthy environments as well as, via user interactions, their counterpart affected by the consequences of an unaddressed climate change and unsustainable human behaviour, exposing predictions based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate report. A user study was conducted, where the gallery was evaluated during two public events. The results showed that opinions about Augmented Gallery were generally very positive. Furthermore, visitors admitted that attending the gallery increased their awareness on environmental issues and their consequences on the planet.",

We conducted a survey study with primary and secondary school teachers in Spain. 67 teachers completed an adapted version of SELFIE to measure the way digital technologies are used for teaching. Respondents were directed to mark two responses to each survey item to reflect the situations both before and during the pandemic. Results indicate that during the pandemic teachers had more training opportunities, found online professional training to be of greater use, and gained confidence in using a wide variety of technologies for both teaching and communicating with parents and students. However, the digital divide among students and a lack of technical resources and support affected their abilities to carry out online education effectively.

abstract="Although museums and archives dispose of extensive cultural heritage data, suitable interfaces for exploration of these collections are lacking. We describe an applied research based on an archive of historic photographs. Our main objective is to engage the general audience in the exploration of this data and thus facilitate discovery and insight. Embodied interaction [1] promises much potential for this endeavour and is highly suitable for museums and exhibition spaces when implemented with vision based technology as no contact with hardware is required. In addition, MR output is attractive for surrounding audiences. To test this assertion, an immersive interactive MR exploration space was developed applying embodied concepts, where the user's position and movement in the interaction space combined with in-air gestures are used for application control of the super-positioned collection data space. A user study was conducted to measure differences in user engagement, exploration behaviour and discovery between this embodied interaction concept and traditional WIMP interaction. With embodied interaction, a significantly higher degree of exploration of the collection space was measured and users discovered slightly more novelties and connections. Additionally, a higher sense of immersion, fresh perspective on the contents and increased interest in the collection were reported. Hedonic qualities (e.g. stimulation, aesthetic appeal, reward factor) scored significantly higher while pragmatic qualities such as perceived usability were lower.",

These vast multimodal corpora include visual and other sensor data and are enriched by content analysis, to generate as extensive a record of an individual's life experience. However, interfacing with such datasets remains an active area of research, and despite the advent of new technology and a plethora of competing mediums for processing digital information, there has been little focus on newly emerging platforms such as virtual reality. In this work, we suggest that the increase in immersion and spatial dimensions provided by virtual reality could provide significant benefits to users when compared to more conventional access methodologies. Hence, we motivate virtual reality as a viable method of exploring multimedia archives (specifically lifelogs) by performing a baseline comparative analysis using a novel application prototype built for the HTC Vive and a conventional prototype built for a standard personal computer.",

abstract="Serious games are digital games that have an additional goal beyond entertainment, e.g., educational games can be a motivational tool for teaching or training players. Among other things, educational games can also be used in IT companies to convey approaches of agile software development. Such learning environments can improve the player's skills in software development processes to reduce risks of schedule delays or incurred cost overruns. In particular, educational games should provide an effective and motivating learning environment for the players and should include hands-on activities to reinforce learning. To this end, we have developed an immersive virtual reality educational game to teach the Scrum framework. This game aims to efficiently train complex processes and improve the player's skills in agile process management. In the virtual environment, players can go through a software development process to discover different activities, such as daily Scrum and sprint planning. The presented paper introduces a game design, results of initial user testings, and subsequent re-design of the early state educational game. The evaluation results of a user study show that the developed game can indeed teach the basics of the Scrum framework to players with little knowledge. However, the game scenario needs to be improved to make it more engaging and immersive for experienced players.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a computer-based training program on the emotional status and its effect on the performance of two students with learning difficulties: a second-grade student of a primary school with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome and a fourth-grade student of a primary school with learning difficulties. For the purpose of this study, the ``BrainHQ'' web-based cognitive training software and the mobile app ``AffectLecture'' were used. The former was used for measuring the affective state of the students before and after each intervention. The latter was used for improving students' cognitive development, in order to evaluate the possible improvement of their initial emotional status after the intervention with ``BrainHQ'' program, the possible effect of positive/negative emotional status on their performance, as well as the possible effect of high/poor performance on their emotional status. The results of the study demonstrate that there is a positive effect of emotion on performance and vice versa and the positive effect of performance on the emotional status and vice versa. These findings suggest that the affective state of students should be taken into account by educators, scholars and policymakers.",

Yet, limited work has explored the connection between the configuration of the CA behavior, the nature of the learning task, and the student behavior in authentic educational settings. In this work, we describe a pedagogical design space of CAs for collaborative learning composed of three dimensions: task design, domain model, and agent intervention strategies. We conduct an initial field study in a university classroom comparing two types of agent intervention strategies based on student participation, dialogue, and satisfaction. 54 university students worked in pairs in the same collaborative brainstorming task with a CA tool and were randomly assigned in two CA conditions with a) knowledge-based prompts to connect two domain concepts, b) social prompts to link their partners' contributions. The results show that students who received knowledge-based prompts significantly exchanged more messages with evidence of explicit reasoning and were more satisfied with the agent and their discussion during the task. Students from both conditions reported problems like the lack of context-awareness and timely interventions by the agent. We discuss the relation between the agent intervention strategies and the task design towards seeking design recommendations for CAs in CSCL.",

When it combines with film art, it gives a new vitality to the film, allowing the audience to gain immersed audio-visual experience, and let them have more interactive links with the film. However, in the context of film, narrative and interaction are contradictory. How to integrate interaction into film narrative is the focus of this paper. First of all, the paper analyzes the audience's psychological motivation while they are watching films to explore when and how do they want to interact, then proposes a new concept ``perceptual interaction'' to define the interaction form of VR films, and summarizes the features of ``perceptual interaction'', including deep immersion and ``suitable to film conditions''. Though great differences are in the design of interactive forms between different categories of films, ``perceptual interaction'' has a set of interacting mechanisms at the emotional level, so the interaction mode of ``attention - cognition - awaken - interaction - feedback'' is proposed, which provides a reference for interaction design of VR films.",

These technologies have drawn criticism for promoting objectifying, data-driven approaches to urban governance that have proven insensitive to the specificity of place and the contexts of citizens' daily lives. Within the digital and spatial humanities, there has been growing interest in `deep mapping' as a means for recovering the sense of place and the nuances of everyday life through the incorporation of spatial narratives and multimedia in their mapping practices. This paper considers the ways in which mixed realities can contribute to these efforts, and in particular the unique affordances of virtual reality for evoking an embodied sense of presence that contributes to the communication of a sense of place via rich multisensory experiences. The paper concludes with the discussion of a pilot study conducted with members of the public. This demonstrates the ways in which virtual environments can be created in ways that maintain contextual and affective links to the places they represent as a result of involvement in `hands-on' activity of mapping through urban sensing and the capture of place-based media.",

abstract="Improving soldiers' resilience and recovery has always been the core of military training for all countries. Current research tends to consider stress negative, which leads to unhealthiness or unhappiness; as a result, some scholars believe that stress should be avoided or reduced as much as possible. Frankly speaking, the existence of stress is inevitable in military environments. For example, turning into a soldier from a civilian in military academy exerts great pressure on freshmen, which is necessary. In practical, the implementation of stress management courses is fragmentary and discontinuous. Such lectures focus more on theories, which could not make students truly comprehend the nature of stress. In this study, stress theory and virtual reality technology design are adopted to overcome the difficulties of current curriculum. For the stress mindset theory, some scholars believe having a stress-is-enhancing mindset will enhance physical and mental health as well as raise the happiness, while having a stress-is-debilitating mindset may cause negative effects on physical and mental health as well as decrease the happiness. Therefore, the theory of curriculum design in this study will adopt the theory of stress-is-enhancing mindset. This viewpoint emphasizes that stress mindset is a belief, and that strengthening an individual's mentality will enhance their ability to face challenges. Through learning stress-is-enhancing mindset, military academy students can well deal with stress in the future. The course adopts a Mindset Training Program proposed by Crum [2], which includes a three-step, two-hour teaching course. In the first part, ``The Paradox of Stress'' introduces the possibility to make people weak or strong through the stress. In the second part, ``The Power of Mindset'', the stress is specified and defined through films and examples to explain how attitudes influence individual's psychology and physiology. In the third part, three steps to strengthen mentality are adopted. The steps aim to help new cadets adopt a positive and conscious way to strengthen mentality. The third part will include virtual reality technology, a kind of computer technology that enables participants to interact with computer-generated three-dimensional scenes. Participants can produce the same behavior and emotions as in real situations, and it takes less time. Finally, the results of this study are expected to give educators a new model for stress management, and further enhance the resilience and recovery of the military.",

Improvement in operators and engineers' cognitive skills is imminent to adapt to Industry 4.0 working environment. Wearable technology, sensors, or virtual reality equipment enhances cognitive capabilities of the Operator 4.0. Thus cognitive skills of the smart operators are required more rather than the physical strength.

abstract="Previous research has exposed the discrepancy between the subject of analysis (real world) and the actual data on which the analysis is performed (data world) as a critical weak spot in visual analysis pipelines. In this paper, we demonstrate how Virtual Reality (VR) can help to verify the correspondence of both worlds in the context of Information Visualization (InfoVis) and Visual Analytics (VA). Immersion allows the analyst to dive into the data world and collate it to familiar real-world scenarios. If the data world lacks crucial dimensions, then these are also missing in created virtual environments, which may draw the analyst's attention to inconsistencies between the database and the subject of analysis. When situating VR in a generic visualization pipeline, we can confirm its basic equality compared to other mediums as well as possible benefits. To overcome the guarded stance of VR in InfoVis and VA, we present a structured analysis of arguments, exhibiting the circumstances that make VR a viable medium for visualizations. As a further contribution, we discuss how VR can aid in minimizing the gap between the data world and the real world and present a use case that demonstrates two solution approaches. Finally, we report on initial expert feedback attesting the applicability of our approach in a real-world scenario for crime scene investigation.",

This research incorporates decision-making style into Technology Threat Avoidance Theory (TTAT) of CybAR game use. This paper particularly focuses on the role of decision-making style in avoidance of risky cybersecurity behaviour based on factors derived from Technology Threat Avoidance Theory (TTAT). A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 95 students at Macquarie University to assess the effect of individual differences, namely, decision-making style, as a moderator variable between motivation behaviour and cybersecurity avoidance behaviour factors. The findings indicated that the moderating effect of decision-making style had a significant effect on avoidance behaviour. In particular, rational decision-making was a strongly significant moderator of avoidance behaviour and cybersecurity avoidance behaviour, while dependent and avoidant styles were less significant moderators of avoidance behaviour and cybersecurity avoidance behaviour.",

abstract="Interacting in 3D has considerable and growing importance today in several areas and most computer systems are equipped with both a mouse or touchscreen and one or more cameras that can be readily used for gesture-based interaction. Literature comparing mouse and free-hand gesture interaction, however, is still somewhat sparse in regards to user satisfaction, learnability and memorability, which can be particularly important attributes for applications in education or entertainment. In this paper, we compare the use of mouse-based interaction with free-hand bimanual gestures to translate, scale and rotate a virtual 3D object. We isolate object manipulation from its selection and focus particularly on those three attributes to test whether the related variables show significant differences when comparing both modalities. To this end, we integrate a gesture recognition system, Microsoft's Kinect and an educational virtual atlas of anatomy, then design and perform an experiment with 19 volunteers, combining data from self-reported metrics and event logs. Our results show that, in this context, the difference is indeed significant and favors the use of gestures for most experimental tasks and evaluated attributes.",

The algorithm for the development of trainers in higher educational establishments is also recommended. At the same time, the requirements for the development of trainers were considered, taking into account the primary and secondary characteristics of actions, such as the form of the action, the measure of its generality, as well as the awareness and reasonableness of the actions. In addition, the authors provide a scheme to improve the sign and symbolic activity during the development and use of trainers in the study of engineering disciplines.

abstract="A story app is a children's digital book which takes advantage of the multimedia and multimodality resources of mobile interaction devices. However, the poorly design of the interactive areas (hotspots) in story apps can compromise the reading activity and children's literacy acquisition. This is even more serious in mediated reading between children and parents, since the latter may not know how to use the hotspots or even feel that their presence is superfluous due to the digital resources. Outgoing from this scenario, we have carried out a user study with six parent-child dyads to investigate the effects of hotspots on the readers' experience during mediated reading of three-story apps to identify design problems and opportunities. The study measured five aspects of the interaction with hotspots, namely: 1) understanding, locating and recognizing hotspots; 2) balanced versus unbalanced number of interactions; 3) reading flow versus reading difficulties during the interaction; 4) engagement versus distraction in reading caused by the interactions; 5) distance versus closeness in mediation. The analyses indicate that hotspots are usually not designed for mediated reading, which may lead to parents' disengagement. Poorly located or misrepresented hotspots caused navigation errors negatively impacting reading. Contrary to findings reported by previous studies, we observed that the interactive game areas can provide a common point for intergenerational convergence stimulating mediated reading.",

The system enables training both the cognitive and physical state using MR technology and maintaining social contacts by connecting seniors with family and friends. Cognitive trainings are provided by conventional and physically available board games - such as Ludo - that are completed with virtual game pieces of a remote partner. Since the system uses real physical game pieces, the user experiences a tactile feedback that enables a more familiar feeling and thus novel way of digital interaction. Physical trainings are provided by a virtual avatar that explains and shows dedicated exercises, adaptable to the individual needs and physical restrictions of the user. Thus, the avatar accompanies the user during the physical training in a more natural way.",

abstract="Maintenance tasks are common operations in manufacturing environments. However, it is becoming increasingly challenging for companies to recruit personnel with adequate skills and tacit knowledge to perform them. This paper proposes the use of augmented reality (AR) as a solution to provide contextually relevant guidance as a method to upskill a user performing a task. However, implementing a disruptive tool such as AR into the workforce requires considerations for acceptability and compliance amongst employees. AugmenTech is a proposed AR guidance application which was designed and tested with a strong focus on usability. Due to issues with the HoloLens native input modalities in the application area, a tactile input module has been designed and integrated with the system. A mock-up bearing replacement maintenance procedure, based on a real-world use case provided by a local manufacturer, has been designed as a platform for evaluation. Using this task and AugmenTech a between-subjects experiment was conducted, comparing the system with a traditional paper documentation approach. Overall workload, quantified using the NASA-TLX, was similar when using AR. Likewise, the use of AR also had minimal effect on time needed to complete the task. The usability of AugmenTech has been quantified, scoring highly, (M = 79.5, SD = 16.13), using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire.",

abstract="Ensuring proper education for employees represents a key factor in most of the industrial sectors. Several researches have been conducted in order to test the efficiency of new educational methods for improving their flexibility and effectiveness. At the same time, the introduction of emergent technologies, such as Virtual Reality (VR), is offering new solutions for industries for both reducing cost of training programmes and for better tailoring those on the needs of the users. Based on a first cross-industry reflection, the paper analyses how the combination of adaptive learning methods with VR could bring substantial benefits to companies (railway and process industry) in replacing the actual training programmes based on traditional learning approaches. Firstly, the paper offers a short overview on the features of adaptive learning and VR. Secondly, a consideration on the main requirements on railway sector and process industry is conducted in order to link them with constrains appeared during the current training programmes. Finally, possible solutions based on the previous findings are highlighted in order to sketch a possible working framework for creating a Virtual Reality Adaptive Learning Tool. Our research, thereby, shows how long-term strategic educational policies can impact the performance of the industries.",

Based on analysis of the up-to-date problems of AR devices practical use like limited usability of AR goggles, low performance and quality of image recognition in real time there is proposed a new approach of accented visualization. The paper addresses some problems of machine vision application for production quality control, which helps solving the challenges for AR guides and improving the efficiency of their implementation in practice. In particular, augmented reality allows users to undergo interactive training and receive active assistance during the execution of technological operations without the need to refer to a set of documentation in paper or electronic form. Within the developed framework there is presented a new solution architecture that combines the capabilities of neural networks, Ontologies and Big Data processing facilities. The proposed approach is recommended to improve the quality of recognizing production operations and manufactured products using machine vision technologies and neural networks in industrial applications.",

Industry 4.0 is a new paradigm of production and one that leads to a faster and more precise decision-making, entirely new approach to production, work organization manner of work task performance, which may have a significant influence on the health and safety of workers. Objectives: To provide an overview of potential effects (positive and negative) of Industry 4.0 on occupational health and safety and to list some of the recommendations regarding the integration of OHS into manufacturing in the Industry 4.0 context. Methods: A critical review of the literature currently available on this topic. Results: There are many risks as well as opportunities for occupational health and safety that derive from Industry 4.0. A considerable challenge, especially in the transitional period, is posed by insufficiency of initiatives with respect to occupational health and safety including standards and regulations, which may render them incommensurate in the face of newer and newer threats as Industry 4.0 technologies emerge. Furthermore, it may lead to forfeiting the proactive approach towards occupational health and safety that has been established in the most industrialized countries. Further research is required to enhance integration of occupational health and safety into manufacturing in the context of Industry 4.0. To achieve this, an interdisciplinary approach needs to be adopted drawing on the expertise of a team comprising engineers, IT experts, psychologists, ergonomists, social and occupational scientists, medical practitioners, and designers. The overview was carried by the research group IDEAT.",

abstract="First person videos and games are the central paradigms of camera positioning when using Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). In these situations, the user's hands and arms play a fundamental role in self-presence feeling and interface. While their visual image is trivial in Augmented Reality devices or when using depth cameras attached to the HMDs, their rendering is not trivial to be solved with regular HMD, such as those based on smartphone devices. This work proposes the usage of semantic image segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks for detaching user's hands and arms from a raw image, captured by regular cameras, positioned as a First Person visual schema. We first create a training dataset composed by 4041 images and a validation dataset composed of 322 images, both of them receive labels for an arm and no-arm pixels, focused on the egocentric view. Then, based on two important architectures related to semantic segmentation - PSPNet and Deeplab - we propose a specific calibration for the particular scenario composed of hands and arms, captured from an HMD perspective. Our results show that PSPNet has better detail segmentation while Deeplab achieves best inference time performance. Training with our egocentric dataset generates better arm segmentation than using images in different and more general perspectives.",

This paper introduces an omnichannel value chain model underpinned by Porter's value chain and presents ten channel integration activities for value creation by carrying out a comprehensive synthesis of current research on omnichannel retailing. We also identify the technology related challenges faced by retailers in the execution of these channel integrating activities drawing upon a case study with an Irish retailer. Enabling digital technologies are then mapped to these activities that provide a guideline for retailers to select appropriate technologies for the value creation activities.",

The scope of the project consists of presentations, experimental applications, observations, individual and collaborative studies, assessment and evaluation practices, e-learning applications, and a social program. The project was conducted as a one- week program at a public university in Turkey with the participation of 18 undergraduate 3rd-year students. Participants consist of students from computer engineering and software engineering departments of the engineering faculties and the business department of the faculty of economics and administrative sciences. Thus, participants of the project had the opportunity to exchange information with students and faculty members from different academic backgrounds. The study utilized the mixed methods approach by performing both quantitative and qualitative measurements. To collect data, mini projects and project evaluation forms were used for quantitative measurements and daily virtual classroom sessions and a general evaluation session (focus group interview) were used for qualitative measurements. The success rates of the participants based on the evaluation of the reports they presented were obtained as 91{\%} in data mining, 95{\%} in industrial automation and human-machine interface, and 89{\%} in machine learning course, respectively. It was observed that the overall satisfaction level of the participants from the project activities was over 95{\%}. These findings were also supported by the qualitative findings as the students indicated their overall satisfaction from the organization of the project and stated that working in teams and attending the social program contributed to developing positive relationships with each other and increasing their success.",

abstract="Synthesizing three-dimensional objects from single or multiple two-dimensional views has been a challenging task. To combat this, several techniques involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have been proposed. Since its advent in 2014, there has been a tremendous amount of research done in the area of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Among the various applications of GANs, image synthesis has shown great potential due to the power of two deep neural networks---generator and discriminator, trained in a competitive way, which are able to produce reasonably realistic images. Formulation of 3D-GANs---which are able to generate three-dimensional objects from multiple two-dimensional views with impressive accuracy---has emerged as a promising solution to the aforementioned issue. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of deep learning methods used in generating three-dimensional objects, reviews the different models and frameworks for three-dimensional object generation, and discusses some evaluation metrics and future research direction in using GANs as an alternative for simultaneous localization and environment mapping as well as leveraging the power of GANs to revolutionize the field of education and medicine.",

In order to utilize diegetic UI for immersion in VR learning content, we classified the diegetic UI that is mediated as an element in the VR environment into the following three types in our VR project. First, the diegetic UI mediated as a place can provide a realistic experience as a friendly place where we can visit easily even in ordinary times or a fantastic experience as an imaginary place that is hard to experience in reality. Second, the diegetic UI mediated as an agency plays a role in virtual reality in which the character becomes the subject of the story or helps the story progress in virtual reality. Third, the diegetic UI mediated as sensory is not limited to audiovisual as a means of interaction in virtual reality, but it enhances immersion by increasing interaction by utilizing all human senses.",

abstract="Situational awareness is a crucial aspect for the survivability of combat vehicles and soldiers in the battlefield, as well as for the prevention of fratricide and collateral damage. Optical, radio and acoustic sensors for monitoring the battlefield can significantly increase situational awareness by providing further information to the crew. However, in time-critical situations, a crew can encounter problems when attempting to make meaningful use of this information, as cognitive resources are otherwise occupied during other operations, e.g. controlling a vehicle. Research from various fields clearly indicates that the correct use of Augmented Reality (AR) enables the crew to pay significantly greater attention to the current tasks, while maintaining an overview of the tactical situation. Adaptation strategies for presenting AR symbols as well as a multi modal approach can be used to distribute the workload. This paper deals with the use of AR in the Field, especially in a military context. It describes the practical use of AR, the exploratory methodology for creating new cues and gives an outlook on further possible uses.",

abstract="In the aeronautical industry, development of fundamental skills in durability and damage tolerance is critically important for most engineers engaged in structural design and analysis tasks. These skills are not usually well covered in most U.S. university undergraduate curricula, and individual coaching or on-the-job training are simply not efficient means of acquiring these skills at a basic level. An additional consideration is that the traditional classroom instruction formats are losing some of their effectiveness, as modern learners entering the workforce today have grown accustomed to a more hands-on style of learning. As a pilot program in transforming the Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) Structures Engineering New Hire (or foundational) training, we have recently rebuilt the introductory durability and damage tolerance (DaDT) portion of this curriculum, originally developed nearly 20 years ago, with a more learner-centric focus. The introductory DaDT syllabus covers the fundamentals of durability, fail-safety and damage tolerance, and how these principles are used at BCA. Boeing has thousands of engineers engaged in work that is pertinent to the structural integrity of our commercial airplanes. Many of these engineers go on to take more in-depth training in which they learn how to apply our proprietary DaDT methods. We have recently taken a new approach for this introductory course, which embraces modern learning methods as a means to increase student engagement and learning and knowledge/skill retention. In this paper we provide an overview of this endeavor and we share our learning architecture model, the perceived benefits, testimonials from learners, and our plans for the future.",

abstract="Graduate education system is in the process of ongoing changes driven by the employers' requirements, ongoing demographic changes, changes in students' career expectations and the new vision of a wider scientific enterprise. There is a need to refocus graduate educational system from the needs of the academic institution and related research towards student-centered paradigm. The purpose of this research is to analyze the practice of STEM doctoral studies from the student-centered perspective by examining a case practice from a doctoral educational event. The paper deals with the questions whether the aims and expectations of graduate students are consistent with the goals and requirements of academics (researchers and teaching staff of higher education) and to what extent; what aspects of academic policy and pedagogical approaches correspond to the needs and requirements of the non-academic and innovative industries; and how the students understand their career prospects in terms of innovation, future job requirements, and knowledge-based entrepreneurship requests. In order to address this problem, a case study was conducted in four dimensions: academia, pedagogy, industry and entrepreneurship. As a result, a qualitative study provided several implications for organizations preparing future researchers and employees. The results show which students' needs, challenges and problems and relevant requirements for academic institutions are related to the prospects of STEM education with an emphasis on computing (computer science) and software engineering as an integrating part.",

abstract="Direct volume rendering is used to visualize data from sources such as tomographic imaging devices. The perception of certain structures depends very much on visual cues such as lighting and shadowing. According illumination techniques have been proposed for both surface rendering and volume rendering. However, in the case of direct volume rendering, some form of precomputation is typically required for real-time rendering. This however limits the application of the visualization. In this work we present adaptive volumetric illumination sampling, a ray-casting-based direct volume rendering method that strongly reduces the amount of necessary illumination computations without introducing any noise. By combining it with voxel cone tracing, realistic lighting including ambient occlusion and image-based lighting is facilitated in real-time. The method only requires minimal precomputation and allows for interactive transfer function updates and clipping of the visualized data.",

abstract="This paper presents an outreach program aimed to introduce high school students to the basic concepts of intelligent robotics, internet of things (IoT), digital simulation, and programming in Robot Operating System (ROS). The challenge of teaching the emerging technologies to school students was addressed through collaboration of engineering educators from Technion and MIT and professional engineers from PTC Corp. The participants were 15 high school students majoring in computer science. The program included three parts studied at the Technion. In the robotics course, the students constructed and programmed mobile robotic arms to pick and place objects of unknown weight and communicate via the IoT platform ThingWorx. In the second course, the school students programmed a TurtleBot Waffle robot equipped by LIDAR sensor to navigate in an environment by means of simultaneous localization and mapping. In the mini project the students programmed two mobile robotic arms and the Waffle to implement a warehouse scenario, in which the robots jointly carried out loading, transportation and warehousing of a cargo. Assessment results indicated that the students acquired initial understanding of the studied concepts. The program raised their interest in intelligent robotics and awareness about technological and social changes associated with Industry 4.0.",

abstract="Deep Learning (DL) modeling has been a recent topic of interest. With the accelerating need to embed Deep Learning Networks (DLNs) to the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, many DL optimization techniques were developed to enable applying DL to IoTs. However, despite the plethora of DL optimization techniques, there is always a trade-off between accuracy, latency, and cost. Moreover, there are no specific criteria for selecting the best optimization model for a specific scenario. Therefore, this research aims at providing a DL optimization model that eases the selection and re-using DLNs on IoTs. In addition, the research presents an initial design for a DL optimization model management framework. This framework would help organizations choose the optimal DL optimization model that maximizes performance without sacrificing quality. The research would add to the IS design science knowledge as well as the industry by providing insights to many IT managers to apply DLNs to IoTs such as machines and robots.",

Mobile devices have evolved from mere simple handheld mobile phones that enabled voice calls only a few years back to smartphone devices that enable the user to access applications and value-added services anytime, anyplace. All of these, together with the recent reigniting of cloud computing technology, has spearheaded into the opportunistic and economically viable Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) as the next innovative technology and ultimately a utility wave such as electricity or water. But this has created huge loopholes in facilitating reliable, scalable, performance oriented, safe, secure and auditable trusted services at affordable prices and profitability. Thus, this research proposal aims to create a fully-fledged Mobile Commerce-based Safe Mobile Cloud Computing (MCSMCC) framework to specifically accommodate Safe MCC (SMCC) with economic pricing models and e-trading schemes. As for the safety measures comprising of security, privacy, trust, identity management, audit and digital forensics among other related measures to suit SMCC, the objectives are to define and specify the necessary processes and protocols for secure e-trading, These objectives are further complimented by further defining and specifying SMCC pricing schemes that will be fair and equitable to users and vendors alike, and encourage critical mass market uptake and usage with confidence. Both of these central objectives will be experimented through simulation and prototyping to test and verify their purpose, effectiveness and efficiency.",

abstract="Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of death in the UAE, causing one in every five deaths. Effective Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) can significantly improve mortality and morbidity rates, leading to longer independent living and a reduced use of healthcare resources. The proposed project, namely Care4MyHeart, sets as an overall goal to introduce a personalized home-based CR program, enabling lifestyle behavioral change towards increased quality of life, surpassing the currently unsustainable provision of healthcare for CVD. In particular, the Care4MyHeart-Pesronalized Serious Game (C4MH-PSG) platform targets CVD patients entering Phase III, as this is where large numbers of patients, who would benefit significantly from exercise and CR, drop out. C4MH-PSG supports the key predictors for attendance to CR Phase III programs, including high program availability, ease of access to program location, high social connectivity, peer support (when peers share similar problems or/and can become peer mentors), and high self-efficacy. Within C4MH-PSG, advanced machine learning and modelling techniques are employed to propose gender- and age-specific CVD exercise programs and an autonomous helper-agent, providing informed feedback to the patient and the related physician/carer, establishing a collaborative patient-professional partnership. C4MH-PSG is realized via motion capture, exercise evaluation, physiological and lifestyle monitoring, exercise gaming, home-based human-computer interfacing, multi-parametric data modelling and advanced decision support systems. Finally, the overall concept and system are easily transferable to address other diseases/conditions (e.g., diabetes, osteoporosis, obesity), providing market opportunities for the commercialization of C4MH-PSG beyond CVD.",

abstract="Intuitive second screen experiences involving smartphone or tablet use are currently not possible with existing VR systems. Whenever users are immersed in a virtual reality world, interactive features and content are usually presented as pop-up windows and floating-text notifications, immediately breaking user immersion, serving as a reminder they are navigating a computer-generated environment. In this paper we discuss how to introduce second screen experiences in VR by orchestrating interplay between using handheld devices while using a VR headset. This entails allowing the users to interface with the touchscreen display despite the opaque, view-obstructing visor. We propose achieving this through a ``mobile second-screen interreality system'' (MSIS), referring a virtual 3D smart device representation inside the VR world, which is tightly coupled with its real-world counterpart, allowing users to manipulate, interface with, and look at the actual device screen, as if the head-mounted display were not present. This can be achieved via advanced screen-sharing technology, and pixel-perfect mapping between the real device and its virtual ``double'', ensuring basic functions (such as typing on an on-screen keyboard and/or tapping on application icons) can be carried out effortlessly. Advanced hand and finger-tracking can be used to represent the user's virtual hands' and fingers' movements on the screen, further enhancing virtual presence, and cementing the links established between the human brain and virtual reality space.",

In this research project, information was collected on the community of Pilahu{\'i}n through an information card of the Food Heritage Atlas of Ecuador. For the development of the mobile application (App) two methodologies were used: ADDIE and TAM. The first one was used since it has an educational concept. It encompasses five stages. In the first stage, the analysis was done through a survey given to the residents of the community. The second stage refers to the design through sketches of the primary and secondary screens of the App. The third stage has to do with the development. At this stage, the Mobincube software was used to create the App. The fourth stage is implementation. Here the application was introduced in the initial version in the Android software application store so that users can access it directly. Finally, in the fifth stage which includes evaluation, the TAM methodology was applied for the measurement of technological acceptability. This acceptance was measured through a survey of several potential users taken by random probabilistic sampling. As a result, it was obtained that the community of Pilahu{\'i}n mostly agreed to offer digital tourism, which is a significant contribution to the development of tourism trends appropriate to the digital era.",

abstract="Exercise video games (exergames) are increasingly being employed as a complementary intervention to promote physical activity engagement in response to the need for creating sustainable strategies for supporting health. While exergames have shown that they can have comparable effects to conventional human-guided training programs in certain situations, its adoption in healthcare applications are still limited. This is in part because of a disconnection between the technology/content producers, healthcare providers, and end-users. Many design frameworks have been proposed to guide the process of creating games for health, however, what is missing is an integrated and multifaceted approach that includes the preliminary research and evaluation stages that are needed to create plausible solutions for exergames. Furthermore, relevant stakeholders are often not included throughout the entire process, neglecting the importance of transdisciplinary collaborations when creating exergames for health. This paper presents the Multidisciplinary Iterative Design of Exergames (MIDE) framework as a comprehensive, integrative, and specific framework for exergame design, development, and evaluation following different research methods, techniques and tools. The MIDE framework is intended to support researchers, healthcare professionals, and industrial experts in identifying the stages, processes, techniques, and key roles needed to create novel exergames for exercise promotion. As older adults are a key user group, applicability of the framework is illustrated using considerations for older adults and immersive experiences (e.g., virtual reality). A specific use case is presented at the end of the paper to illustrate the use of the MIDE framework in the context of a project of using virtual reality exergames for promoting exercise in people living with dementia.",

Current interaction scenarios with pervasive computing technologies present design challenges for the applicability of standards and guidelines such as those of the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), suited for Web systems. Such scenarios require further studies to deal with the endeavor of supporting designers to project pervasive interactive systems that consider all people, regardless of their condition and ability, allowing different types of interactions to arise. In this article, we conduct an exploratory study to investigate the potential and limitations of current accessibility guidelines for pervasive systems. We explore the last decade of literature studies presenting solutions and challenges for accessibility found for pervasive and ubiquitous computing contexts. The results of this research indicate that it is desirable to define accessibility models for pervasive systems if we consider an accessibility layer that will indicate principles and solutions that should be generic enough to support different categories of impairments and contexts.",

In a project challenge, students were instructed to transform their basic ideas on the drone's design from paper to three dimensions and then into an immersive design reviewing experience. Following this path, digital continuity turned out as a comprehensible and at the same time exciting way of product development.",

These systems are represented as directed acyclic graphs with nodes representing different technologies and data or media types. The naming of system and data components is intended to be populated by a subjective, personal ontology. The source material can be simply modified by a user who wishes to explore a space of possibilities, constrained by specific resources, to generate simple visual descriptions of systems that can be quickly browsed. These dataflow visualizations are a familiar representation to those who use visual programming interfaces for creative media processing. An interactive genetic programming based approach is used with small populations of individual designs. The system is being developed using web browser technology. A minimum functionality proof of concept system has been implemented. Next steps and current challenges are discussed.",

abstract="Having a good Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design is challenging. Previous works have contributed significantly to fostering HCI, including design principle with report study from the instructor view. The questions of how and to what extent students perceive the design principles are still left open. To answer this question, this paper conducts a study of HCI adoption in the classroom. The studio-based learning method is adapted to teach 83 graduate and undergraduate students in 16 weeks long with four activities. A standalone presentation tool for instant online peer feedback during the presentation session is developed to help students justify and critique other's work. Our tool provides a sandbox, which supports multiple application types, including Web-applications, Object Detection, Web-based Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR). After presenting one assignment and two projects, our results shows that students acquired a better understanding of the Golden Rules principle over time, which is demonstrated by the development of visual interface design. The Wordcloud reveals the primary focus was on the user interface and sheds light on students' interest in user experience. The inter-rater score indicates the agreement among students that they have the same level of understanding of the principles. The results show a high level of guideline compliance with HCI principles, in which we witness variations in visual cognitive styles. Regardless of diversity in visual preference, the students present high consistency and a similar perspective on adopting HCI design principles. The results also elicit suggestions into the development of the HCI curriculum in the future.",

abstract="In this paper I set out to present a series of categories for artists working with and about Artificial Intelligence [AI]. My approach is more observational than rigidly taxonomic. Having the opportunity to curate a substantial exhibition on this topic, I undertook a year long program of research which encompassed and extended into lengthy conversations with many artists working internationally in the field. This culminated in the exhibition ``Future Intelligence'' at Tank Museum, Shanghai, 13 December 2019 to 5 January 2020. A number of distinct themes and sub-themes became apparent through this research: Aesthetic and Philosophical, Representation, Identity and Self Awareness, AI and A-life, and Interpretation and Narrative are the major themes. As one would expect, many of the artists and their works explore multiple themes. Additionally, as with all media art practice, artists utilise a large range of diverse approaches to the application of interfaces for audience engagement and interaction, hence I have briefly examined these structurally but not within the thematics. I make specific reference to many, but not all of the artworks that featured in the exhibition as well as a number of other artists and artworks. The paper also presents somewhat of a limited survey of current international practice over the last three years, without attempting to be exhaustive. A more exhaustive list of artists working with AI can be found at AIArtists.org; the global directory of artists working in this field [1].",

abstract="There have been significant efforts in the direction of improving accuracy in detecting human action using skeleton joints. Determining actions in a noisy environment is still challenging since the Cartesian coordinate of the skeleton joints provided by depth sense camera depends on camera position and skeleton position. In a few of the human-computer interaction applications, skeleton position and camera position keep changing. The proposed method recommends using relative positional values instead of actual Cartesian coordinate values. Recent advancements in the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) help us achieve higher prediction accuracy using image format input. To represent skeleton joints in image format, we need to represent skeleton information in matrix form with equal height and width. With some depth sense cameras, the number of skeleton joints provided is limited, and we need to depend on relative positional values to have a matrix representation of skeleton joints. We can show near the state-of-the-art performance on MSR 3-Dimensional (3D) data and the new representation of skeleton joints. We have used image shifting instead of interpolation between frames, which helps us have state-of-the-art performance.",

abstract="Prototyping is one of the most critical and costly steps in the product development process. However, the existing literature lacks in prototyping strategies that are comprehensive and widely accepted. Current prototyping strategies mostly focus on the hands-on activity of building the prototype by relying on the designer's experience. Another limitation is that prototyping strategies often do not address human factors for prototyping human-centered products. This paper introduces a House of Prototyping Guidelines (HOPG) framework, which integrates the existing prototyping guidelines and human factor engineering principles for better prototyping outcomes. The methodology contains four steps. The first step pertains to the state-of-the-art prototyping literature review. The second step consists of filtering the prototyping findings and summarizing the key prototyping findings from Step 1. The third step presents the HOPG conceptual map, which is loosely based on the House of Quality (HOQ) approach. HOPG contains the Prototyping Categories and Prototyping Dimensions, which are similar to Customer Requirement and Engineering Requirement of HOQ, respectively. In the HOPG framework, designers go through the Prototyping Categories to understand the prototyping requirements and then identifies the Prototyping Dimensions to create the prototypes that fit human-centered design needs.",

The four HCD tools intervene on idea generation, data collection planning, and both low and high-fidelity prototyping of the solutions. The aim is to assist designers, developers, and engineers in producing better H{\&}S integrated solutions by offering tools that meet HCD principles. The primary usage of the HCD tools with 27 graduate students assisted these multidisciplinary teams in creating five prototypes that were positively evaluated by end-users. Technical evaluation checks for the integrity of the prototypes after testing and results show comparative data on battery consumption and list potential privacy and security vulnerabilities. Improvements include adapting ideation tool to incorporate marketing-oriented strategies, authentication and data encryption for the toolkit, and assessing the tools with professional teams of the industry.",

It is shown that against the background of all-Russian changes in the institutional environment, one of the most important issues is the formation of a stable, long-term partnership between universities and industry. New innovative challenges require the strengthening of interaction between scientific, educational, and industrial spheres. In this regard, it is necessary to make a significant emphasis on the variability of higher education, which contributes to its adaptation to the new conditions of academic and economic autonomy of educational institutions. Research and innovation activities should be focused on obtaining new knowledge in the main strategic directions, the purpose of which is to attract young people from the sphere of science and education, to train highly qualified specialists, and to develop a socially oriented and competitive system of higher professional education. An important factor is the creation of new structural subdivisions aimed at organizing interaction between higher education institutions, research institutes, and enterprises in priority areas of research and education. It is shown that the integration of universities is the result of a targeted policy of increasing the competitiveness of higher education and states that use this potential for the development of their economy and social sphere. Stimulation of mutually beneficial partnership, creation of new graduate departments at production; research and innovation activities should contribute to the commercialization of scientific results and provide the Russian economy with qualified specialists with the necessary set of competencies for the generation and practical use of knowledge and skills in the field of information and energy-saving technologies, engineering, automation, new materials, etc.",

abstract="A few years ago, the proliferation of new devices with improved technological characteristics and interfaces, associated with better communication features and services design, conducted to a change in the viewing paradigm. In fact, users started using devices simultaneously. This convergence tendency, which resulted in the use of different devices as part of the same crossmedia system, has created new opportunities to support a multiplicity of contexts of use, as for instance, the ones associated with learning. This paper addresses the effective design of crossmedia systems to generate personalized informal learning contents from iTV, PC and mobile devices with a special focus on mobile devices. It presents the opportunities and challenges of the inclusion of mobile devices on this crossmedia systems, as well as the design challenges that need to be addressed in order to correctly add the mobility feature. The system that was designed to illustrate our research, named eiTV, generates a crossmedia personalized informal learning content, through the form of a web-based content, which provides extra information about users' selected topics of interest while watching a specific video. The web content may be generated and accessed through iTV, PC and mobile devices and, depending on the users' needs, viewed immediately or stored for latter view, individually or simultaneously, also from iTV, PC and mobile devices. The system was designed and evaluated based on cognitive and affective aspects that influence the user experience. An evaluation was carried out with high fidelity prototypes with a special focus on mobile devices. The achieved results were very good considering that they helped rethink our mobile related assumptions and they showed that the integration of mobile devices on the system was a success.",

abstract="It is well recognized that individuals within organizations represent a significant threat to information security as they are both common targets of external attackers and can be sources of malicious behavior themselves. Notwithstanding these facts, one additional aspect of human influence in the security domain is largely overlooked: the role of unintentional human error. Such lack of emphasis is surprising given relatively recent reports that highlight error's central role in being the root cause for numerous security breaches. Unfortunately, efforts that recognize human error's influence suffer from not employing a commonly accepted error framework and lexicon. We thus take this opportunity to review what the data show regarding error-based breaches across various types of organizations and create a nomenclature and taxonomy rooted in the rich history of safety research that can be applied to the information security domain. Our efforts represent a significant step in an effort to classify, monitor, and compare the myriad aspects of human error in information security in the hopes that more effective security education, training, and awareness (SETA) programs can be devised. Further, we believe our efforts underscore the importance of revisiting the daily demands placed on organizational insiders in the workplace.",

abstract="30 million people across Europe are affected approximately from rare diseases. The brain disorders (including, but not limited to those affecting mental health) remain a major challenge. The understanding of mental disorders' determinants and causes, processes and impacts is a key to their prevention, early detection and treatment as well as factor for good health and well-being. In order to improve the health and disease understanding, a close linkage between fundamental, clinical, epidemiological and socio-economic research is required. Effective sharing of data, standardized data processing and the linkage of such data with large-scale cohort studies is a prerequisite for translation of research findings into the clinic. In this context, this paper proposes a platform for exploration of behavioral changes in patients with proven cognitive disorders with a focus on Multiple Sclerosis. It adopts the concept of a digital twin by applying the Big Data and Artificial Intelligence technologies to allow for deep analysis of medical data to estimate human health status, accurate diagnosis and adequate treatment of patients. The platform has two main components. The first component, provides functionality for diagnostics and rehabilitation of Multiple Sclerosis and acts as a main provider of data for the second component. The second component is an advanced analytical application, which provides services for data aggregation, enrichment, analysis and visualization that will be used to produce a new knowledge and support decision in each instance of the transactional component.",

abstract="A system design for correlating information stimuli and a user's personal information management system (PIMS) is introduced. This is achieved via a deep learning classifier for textual data, a recently developed PIMS graph information architecture, and a principle component analysis (PCA) reduction thereof. The system is designed to return unique and meaningful signals from incoming textual data in or near realtime. The classifier uses a recurrent neural network to determine the location of a given atom of information in the user's PIMS. PCA reduction of the PIMS graph to {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}R{\}}^m{\$}{\$}, with m the actuator (haptic) dimensionality, is termed a PIMS filter. Demonstrations are given of the classifier and PIMS filter. The haptic stimuli, then, are correlated with the user's PIMS and are therefore termed ``metastimuli.'' Applications of this system include educational environments, where human learning may be enhanced.

abstract="Explainability is a hot topic nowadays for artificial intelligent (AI) systems. The role of machine learning (ML) models on influencing human decisions shed light on the back-box of computing systems. AI based system are more than just ML models. ML models are one element for the AI explainability' design and needs to be combined with other elements so it can have significant meaning for people using AI systems. There are different goals and motivations for AI explainability. Regardless the goal for AI explainability, there are more to AI explanation than just ML models or algorithms. The explainability of an AI systems behavior needs to consider different dimensions: 1) who is the receiver of that explanation, 2) why that explanation is needed, and 3) in which context and other situated information the explanation is presented. Considering those three dimensions, the explanation can be effective by fitting the user needs and expectation in the right moment and format. The design of an AI explanation user experience is central for the pressing need from people and the society to understand how an AI system may impact on human decisions. In this paper, we present a literature review on AI explainability research and practices. We first looked at the computer science (CS) community research to identify the main research themes about AI explainability, or ``explainable AI''. Then, we focus on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research trying to answer three questions about the selected publications: to whom the AI explainability is for (who), which is the purpose of the AI explanation (why), and in which context the AI explanation is presented (what + when).",

abstract="This paper presents a novel approach to construct spatially-referenced, multidimensional virtual city models from remotely generated point clouds for areas that lack reliable geographical reference data. A multidimensional point cloud is an unstructured array of single, irregular points in a spatial 3D coordinate system plus time stamp. If geospatial reference points are available, a point cloud is geo-referenced. Geo-referenced point clouds contain a high-precision reference dataset. Point clouds can be utilised in a variety of applications. They are particularly suitable for the representation of surfaces, structures, terrain and objects. Point clouds are used here to generate a virtual 3D city model representing the complex, granular cityscape of Jerusalem and its centre, the Old City. The generation of point clouds is based on two data acquisition methods: active data capture by laser scanning and passive data collection by photogrammetric methods. In our case, very high-resolution stereo imagery in visible light and near infrared bands have been systematically acquired an aerial flight campaign. The spatio-temporal data gathered necessitate further processing to extract the geographical reference and semantic features required in a specific resolution and scale. An insight is given into the processing of an unstructured point cloud to extract and classify the 3D urban fabric and reconstruct its objects. Eventually, customised, precise and up-to-date geographical datasets can be made available for a defined region at a defined resolution and scale.",

abstract="Serious games are games with a purpose beyond entertainment and are widely acknowledged as fruitful tools for learning and developing skills across multiple domains, including educational enhancement. In the last few years, the world of serious games has widely increased. The use of these types of games can aid in classrooms to not only help the students learn concepts but also to improve their motivation to do so. However, designing games necessitates very specialized personnel and the process can often be costly and slow. The adaptions of the design to the implantation phase are also difficult and the process needs more focus. The challenge of this study was to create a game within the confines of cultural heritage and preservation that was an adventure game as well, available on any platform with a friendly user interface and free to download on the web. To achieve this great goal, it was necessary to overcome the limits and problems due to the virtual environment starting from 3D acquisition and finishing with image stability. In this paper, we show the flowchart and methodology for the optimization of a cultural heritage virtual environment for gaming applications.",

abstract="Storytelling is an integral part of narratives relating to our daily events, news, personal experiences, and fantasies. While humans have long narrated their stories, the mediums they have used to do so have evolved over time through the effects of technological developments: initially, storytelling was solely oral, then written forms were added, and now, with the effects of new media, such narratives have also begun to employ photography and video. These new media tools are also undergoing their own processes of expansion and development. Today one of the most attention-getting are those using Virtual Reality (VR) technologies, a means that allows users to experience being-in-the-virtual-environments, with possibilities of becoming entirely immersed in a virtual environment. The ability to experience an environment with three-dimensional features enhances the experience in sensorial ways, with simultaneous stimulation of both the user's visual and auditory sensorial systems. The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of what exactly the user experiences through VR storytelling. To this end we have conducted an experimental research based on an examination of the immersive experience in VR, which constructs the presence feeling. The experiment has been designed to study the effects on forty users. These participants used the HTC Vive head-mounted display to experience the contents of a story called ``Allumette'' (designed by Penrose Studios). User behaviors were recorded and observed by the tools used to collect data from both the physical world and the virtual environment. Users' physical movements were documented as coordinate data, while the behavioral reflections in the virtual environment were recorded as a video. Following this virtual experimentation, users were asked to answer a questionnaire that measured their responses to their VR storytelling experience. User experience was finally measured by analyzing both the behavioral outputs of the subjects and the questionnaire. ``Cinemetrics'' methodology was implemented to analyze the camera movements, which were considered as the user behavioral reflections in VR. The results of this study based on analyzing the behaviors and the reactions to visual and aural stimuli in the VR environment both lead to a clearer understanding of VR storytelling and uses these results to propose a design guide for VR storytelling.",

abstract="A visit to a place of natural beauty is known to have restorative potential. Immersing oneself in nature - relaxing, contemplating, meditating, walking and so on -- can help improve one's mental and physical wellbeing. Suitably designed VR can encourage beneficial meditative states as well as healthy physical activities. We see fully immersive forms of VR as a form of ``synthetic consciousness'' that is a modern addition to the three clearly established classic states of consciousness: wakefulness, dreamless, and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Certain therapeutic and self-care mental health therapies such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) meditation can assist individuals to achieve relative peace of mind. We describe the development of aesthetically-appealing VR programs that were designed to induce mental states of equanimity, hopefulness and child-like wonder, referring back to historical aspects of art and design. We also report work where VR was used to embed actions required for exercise within a meaningful experience with the exercise itself, and the associated effort, becomes secondary in the mind of the participant to the flow, and narrative logic, of the interaction being performed. To increase the ``stickiness'' or attractiveness of our VR approach to exercise we also introduce the idea of rewards for exercise carried out correctly. User groups of ``healthy normal'' adults, mental health patients with clinically significant anxiety, and frail elderly at risk of institutionalization have provided helpful and generally positive feedback.",

This is repeated several times while randomizing and recombining optical features in every iteration. Our data shows that most of the introduced determinants actually do have an impact in the user's decision. We can also observe different intensities of impact depending on the factor. It appears that color is by far the most influential component, followed by the complexity of the doors opening process.

abstract="In today's society characterized by information explosion, the smart phone has become an indispensable convenience in modern people's lives, facilitating information inquiry, shopping, basic needs, as well as entertainment; meanwhile, it has changed people's living habits. Over the past ten or more years, there have been many game-related studies which mainly focused on online games for personal computers (PC). However, with the popularity of smart phones, mobile games have entered the new mainstream of the market. Pok{\'e}mon GO is an online game that combines a mobile device with augmented reality (AR). Through their smartphone screens, players can search for cartoon and animation characters in the real world. Ranging from small children, teenagers, and middle-aged people to old people over 70 years of age, all players try to capture virtual creatures, called Pok{\'e}mon. It is difficult for ordinary mobile online games to attract players of different age groups, i.e., young, middle-aged, and old players at the same time, while Pok{\'e}mon GO enables a wide variety of players to participate in the game simultaneously. Therefore, this study first analyzed the game design of Pok{\'e}mon GO and then explored the interactive factors involving the context where parents and children play together. The semi-structured interview was employed, with three participants interviewed. Through the interview, it was found that the game design of Pok{\'e}mon GO includes the following features: 1) a user-friendly interface, 2) going outdoors, 3) association with places of interest, 4) combining games with exercise, 5) cooperative gaming with the community, and 6) highlighting festivals to attract players. As for its impact on parent-child interaction, Pok{\'e}mon Go boasts the characteristics below: a) a common topic for the family, b) family members doing their cooperative gaming, c) training children to classify things and use logic, and d) fostering children's independence. Due to the foregoing factors, parent-child interaction can improve a lot. The results of this study can be referred to by game designers.",

The main purpose of this chapter is to identify at which stage of preparation for the SMART World are SMEs. The second purpose of the chapter is to identify if and how the size of the enterprise determines the effectiveness of its operation in the age of IR4.0. The studies are based on a literature review and they describe the requirements for organization functioning in the age of IR4.0, a review of international researches and the results of the author's own research on the readiness of SMEs for the SMART World of IR4.0. The findings of the conducted research indicate that the tested SMEs operating in Poland, although increasingly aware of the benefits of the application of modern solutions, still have a too low level of knowledge concerning the requirements of the age of Industry4.0, possess average activity in terms of the use of tools specific to this age, and they are mostly halfway to the SMART world. Furthermore, the bigger the size of a company, the higher the level of readiness for operating in the age IR4.0.

abstract="A Computerized Operator Support System (COSS) has been envisioned and prototyped for nuclear power plant (NPP) operations. The COSS supports operator decision making during abnormal events by making use of an online fault-diagnostic system known as PRO-AID. PRO-AID uses existing sensors and confluence equations to detect system faults before plant threshold alarms would alert operators. In a full-scope, full-scale nuclear power plant simulator we demonstrated that early diagnosis in conjunction with computer-based-procedures can assist operators in mitigating faults in circumstances that would normally lead to shutting down the plant. Here we conceive of a computerized plant management system (CPMS) that would complement COSS. COSS is intended to aid in the short-time scale operations of a plant. The CPMS is aimed at supporting longer time-scale activities involving maintenance, calibration, and early warning fault detection. Digitization allows staff to manage and monitor assets remotely without being physically present locally at the equipment under surveillance. This allows for specialization by equipment and systems rather than location. Cyber-physical systems and the industrial internet of things have no shortage of possibilities and promises, but often the benefits come with conflicting considerations: availability may tradeoff with increased cyber risk, increased redundancy may come at the cost of increased complexity, outsourcing engineering requires more communication across organizations and the associated administrative burden. In too many instances, humans tend to fill the gaps between what automation cannot reliably or cost-effectively accomplish. Human-centered design using human factors considers the role of the human as part of a human-machine-system. Our COSS concept examined how a control system, a diagnostic system, expert guidance system, and computer-based procedure system could work in concert to aid operator actions. Here we examine the potential for human factors and human-centered design for whole plant management using a CPMS. A CPMS could serve several valuable functions from providing computerized procedures for field operations to using prognostics for early failure detection, or managing information flows from sensors to business networks, system engineers, cyber-security personnel, and third-party vendors.",

abstract="Services are the backbone of modern economies and are increasingly supported by technology. Meanwhile, there is an accelerated growth of new technologies that are able to learn from themselves, providing more and more relevant results, i.e. Artificial Intelligence (AI). While there have been significant advances on the capabilities of AI, the impacts of this technology on service provision are still unknown. Conceptual research claims that AI offers a way to augment human capabilities or position it as a threat to human jobs. The objective of this study is to better understand the impact of AI on service, namely by understanding current trends in AI, and how they are, and will, impact service provision. To achieve this, a qualitative study, following Grounded Theory methodology was performed, with ten Artificial Intelligence experts selected from industry and academia.",

abstract="On the background of innovative concepts for the creation of cultural virtual spaces, the article discusses the fiction of form and meaning of traditional culture within virtual worlds. It argues that current digital forms in virtual worlds obscure and separate their cultural context. Moreover, commercially motivated design masks the separation of form and meaning, and the growing realism of virtual reality facilitated by technology is imperceptibly contributing to the intensification of this separation. This has a negative impact on the communication of traditional cultural values within virtual worlds. That is one of the problems between traditional culture, human, machine and virtual environment in modern society. Therefore, by speculating about the relationship and characteristics of the virtual form and the real meaning of digital culture, by means of the design of virtual narrative environments, citing the traditional cultural form and meaning as props, analyzing the relationship between designers and audiences, grounding our observations on design experiments and measurements of data, we can explore the new design ideas of virtual form and meaning of traditional cultural in the virtual environment.",

This change is described on the example of the process of analyzing and discovering the ways through which qualitative research practices are conceptualized and represented in the vivid language of scholarly articles. Taking into account the problem of a ``curse of abundance'' in the present-day field of qualitative research I try to organize and articulate these practices in a legible system of knowledge representation employing the information concept of domain ontology.

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop a GeoWeb system and GeoMobile application or e-mosque exploration in Kuala Lumpur. The methodology involved in developing the system is spatial data collection of mosques data in Kuala Lumpur, data processing, system development, system implementation, and testing. After conducting user requirement, majority of the respondents strongly agreed that the proposed system and applications of discovering mosques in Kuala Lumpur need to be developed completely. The system built has more information on the mosques such as the location can help the user to get the direction of the mosque. Besides, the system also has the important geoinformation such as the activities of the mosques which can help the user to get updated on the activities of the mosque. The respondents corresponded with the overall functions proposed in the system, but the other significant digital elements such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) could be further integrated with the developed system or apps.",

The use of communication technologies to visit and explore museums is certainly crucial for increasing visitor attention and helping them improve their museum experience. Due to the rapid development of these technologies, the expectations of tourists have changed, and museums have ceased to exist as product-centered institutions, instead becoming customer-focused in their approaches. This switch has led museums to seek new ways to attract visitors and create interactive experiences. Gamification is a very innovative technology that aims to capture user attention by offering enjoyable and interactive experiences. This chapter attempts to explore the use of gamification as a tool to enhance the attractiveness of museums from the perspective of visitors. We discuss the implementation of gamification in the context of museums' attraction after clarifying what attraction in tourism is as well as the concept of gamification.",

The results show that circular narrative and multi-view narrative are most affected by the time expansion coefficient. Interactive narrative and multi-view narrative are almost equally affected while linear narrative is less affected. In addition, when time expansion coefficient is greater than 1 (that is, $\alpha${\thinspace}>{\thinspace}1), immersion in all five narrative types we refer to is improved.",

We begin by demonstrating how activity declines with age using an analysis of survey data (from 2003--2015) reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics on American Time Use Usage. We use multiple discriminant analysis to characterize which activities tend to become more, or less frequent as people age. We then review previous exergame approaches for motivating physical activity. After this we discuss a pedaling system that is designed to motivate and facilitate physical activity in the elderly using a combination of competition, social interaction, and engaging video content. We conclude with a discussion of how to adapt exergaming innovations to the context of use.",

However, our understanding of the human computer interface originates from early HCI research, based on the desktop metaphor, including the user, the system, input and output. This article raises the question, how do we conceptualize user interfaces in our own research and for our teaching. The review reveals that there is no consistent understanding of interface concepts in HCI textbooks and that there is a bias towards the desktop metaphor. As a candidate for an updated interface definition, I propose a revised interface model, including 5 concepts: interface paradigm, interaction technique, interaction style, interface platform and interface device. Finally, I report on two examples, how I have used the interface model in the classroom.",

However, very limited research has been reported on VR usage in this area. Therefore, we conducted a between-groups study to investigate whether the level of presence felt in a VR environment together with a trigger mechanism such as guilt could spark intent to change towards water conservation. Participants were exposed to a persuasive message about water conservation in one of three conditions: audio only, simple VR and visually rich VR. Forty participants completed the study ``in the wild''. The results showed that while intent to change increased in all three groups, both VR groups indicated lower levels of change than the audio only group. Additionally, a positive correlation, albeit small, was found between presence and cued recall along with presence and intent to change. These results furthermore showed that presence could play a role in behavior modification and intent to change.",

abstract="The objective of AI-based masked language modeling (MLM) is to mask one or more words in a sentence and have the Natural Language Processing (NLP) model identify the masked words given the other words (representing context) in a sentence. In this study, using real examples collected from an online translation study group, we identify multiple human strategies to perform masked language modeling tasks: looking up definitions; comparing/contrasting; relying on common sense and knowledge; relying on statistical properties of past experiences; building an augmented context (using a list of keywords); and using it on a web search engine. In terms of human versus machine performance, the MLM algorithm's performance is equal to the level of an average human expert, but it still cannot compete with the best human performance. The human experts' strengths are the awareness of global knowledge, deep understanding of concepts, events, public opinion, etc. The human experts' usual weaknesses, on the other hand, are the lack of domain knowledge and human biases. The machine's strength is its comprehensive and encompassing coverage gleaned by learning from a large corpus, so that it can sometimes fill human experts' knowledge gaps and correct human bias. But the machine could suffer from lack of true understanding and machine bias due to misleading statistical patterns. One common trait shared by human experts and the MLM algorithm is that they both can make decisions based on statistical observations. Therefore, it stands to reason that a human and machine can form a team to achieve better overall performance. In most cases, humans are not aware of their knowledge limitation or bias, so AI algorithm should take a proactive role in making suggestions, not a reactive role to be activated when human feels the need. In addition, it would be beneficial if the AI algorithm lists definition and sample usages of the word they suggest because humans need to be educated. The important skills demonstrated by human experts seem to be their ability to manipulate context for sensitivity analyses and/or the ability to gauge context-word interactions to understand the context. To improve human-machine teaming, it would be beneficial to incorporate human creativity into interface and interaction designs---humans can quickly input different context manipulation and word-context combinations, and the machine can provide quick feedback based on its extensive knowledge based from a large corpus. This teaming arrangement helps facilitate the joining of forces between human creativity and machine intelligence.",

Identifying these components of high risk can inform how resources should be best used on costly modelling tasks. In addition, high risk components may impose functional modelling requirements, which in turn will inform the design of flexible systems for critical areas. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce risk by focusing and informing modelling efforts, which in turn increases the chance of success of the project and lowers costs for all stakeholders involved.",

abstract="Finding the correct hotspots when interacting with digital picturebooks is oft challenging for children. Here, we present an exploratory study carried out with a group of third graders to inform the design of hotspot icons for a children's digital picturebook. Based on a selection and analysis of the most commonly used icons in digital picturebooks, especially apps, we created a low fidelity paper prototype to investigate children's preferences and understanding of the interactive navigation areas, configuration and menus. For this, we invited the children to draw new icons for each hotspot. Based on the analysis of the results we designed a proposal of icons that were implemented in a digital prototype for tablets. The prototype was then validated with a similar group of children, and the results provided valuable insights for the design of hotspots that can be useful for researchers and designers working and developing digital picturebooks for children.",

Object detection and tracking are the most challenging task faced by different software or computer applications. Especially in dynamic environment for recognizing the living beings is the greatest difficulty faced by applications, as it involves efficient object detection system in environments that are very complex. In image processing, object detection is considered to be a very difficult process. Many solutions for this problem involve the usage of deep learning techniques where a set of data is given to the machine which saves the key features of the objects and help in giving the desired output. This paper describes comprehensive survey on various methods and techniques used for object detection during natural disasters and finally comparative study of different methods are discussed.",

abstract="Smart city is a multi-faceted concept perceived in many different perspectives. Cities are multidimensional and highly complex interconnected systems of people, software, machines, and data, bringing new design, construction, and operational challenges. Work has been done on models and reference architectures for smart cities that can help to cope with those challenges. However, also because of the variability of concepts, arrangements of key components, and technology heterogeneity, a unique and universal smart city reference architecture for real world deployment is distant. This paper attempts to clarify the meaning of the concept smart cities, trying to reveal its mostly accepted dimensions and the best arrangement between them. Through an in-depth literature review of relevant studies from academia, international organizations, corporations, and standards development organizations, that gathered and analyzed contributions ranging from smart cities definition attempts and enunciations of their relevant dimensions, to already existing models and urban platforms, the paper proposes a classification for grouping the identified smart cities dimensions, exposed on a unified reference model for smart cities.",

abstract="We present a novel display and visual interaction paradigm, which aims at reducing the complexity of understanding the spatial transformations between the surgeon's viewpoint, the patient, the pre- or intra-operative 2D and 3D data, and surgical tools during computer assisted interventions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in which the traditional interventional display, for example in surgical navigation systems, is registered both to the patient and to the surgeon's view. The closest concept is that of traditional Augmented Reality windows in which a semitransparent or video see-through display is positioned between the surgeon and the patient. In such cases, the system was providing an AR view into the patient. In the new concept introduced here, the surgeon keeps his/her own direct view to the patient without any need for additional display or direct view augmentation, but the monitor used in the operating room is now registered to the patient and surgeon's viewpoint. The display could act as fixed viewing frustum or as a mirror frustum relative to the surgeon's view. This allows the physicians to effortlessly relate their view of tools and patient to the virtual representation of the patient data. In this paper, the first realization and implementation of such a concept is presented and three clinical partners have tested the system and their first feedback is discussed in detail. They unanimously believe that this concept opens the path for facilitating interactive exploration of data and more intuitive navigation guidance in computer assisted interventions.",

The use of blockchain supports the interoperability-by-default concept in the creation of public services. At the same time blockchain is addressing another important problem governments facing across all over the world, namely, low level of citizens' trust. In this paper, the authors review literature and projects on blockchain as a tool for improving interoperability and trust in Government 3.0 and they outline the issues for further research in the area, taking into consideration the knowledge collected in existing projects and the opinions of experts in the domain. The research needs are synthesized a) by analysing recent EU-funded projects involving blockchain and b) by drawing a future scenario, which is evaluated by experts to formulate further research needs. Finally, fifteen research needs are identified for blockchain in digital government.",

abstract="User-centered physical-digital systems let designers create interactive interfaces filled with special moments and experiences, giving brand owners the chance to have profound communication with their consumers. In fact, product's packaging has recently begun to investigate as one of such interfaces to form a strong link between manufacturers and their end-users. Microprocessors, sensors, actuators and wireless data-exchange supporting chips can be embedded, into packaging design creating an extended user interface -- a touchpoint for a visual, tactile and digital encounter with consumers. Near Field Communication (NFC) is one of the rapidly increasing technologies that researchers begin to investigate as a potential tool for enhanced consumer-brand communication. However, although NFC is available in the market since late 2010, the technology is still not widely applied to the packaging industry. As a result, the main purpose of this research is to investigate the current state-of-the-art and potentials of NFC system. The results of this study provide a systematic review of NFC characteristics, including technological capabilities, consumer- and brand-oriented benefits, and technology- and user-centered potential barriers for NFC to become widely accepted. The findings of this study are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness of NFC-enabled packaging, allowing brands to dynamically adapt to emerging consumer needs by improving their products and services.",

abstract="Structural complexity, a recognized feature of academic writing, has been recently proven by Biber and Gray (Journal of English for Academic Purposes, 9: 2--20, 2010) to be embedded in nominal expressions with phrasal modifiers. However, little has been done to identify the problems that novice Chinese academic writers might face when using nominal expressions to compress information, especially from a functional perspective. This chapter explores the most common phrasal modifier---of--phrases---aiming to find how novice Chinese academic writers in computer science differ from more advanced science writers regarding the discourse-semantic function in which nominal expressions with of-phrases as postmodifiers (NP-of phrases) perform. NP-of phrases retrieved from two self-built corpora of master's thesis abstracts from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and ProQuest were investigated both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our findings show that novice Chinese academic writers use NP-of phrases more frequently but do not compress information as effectively as more advanced writers. For the semantic function, they tend to underuse NP-of phrases with an internal nominalized relationship and overuse some head nouns before of-phrases in certain abstract moves. For the discoursal function, they use fewer NP-of phrases in the verbalized cause--effect relationship, especially in the problemizing step, the result move and conclusion move. These deficiencies may hinder novice Chinese academic writers' ability to produce compact and compelling academic discourse with the meaning-making function of the NP-of phrase enabled by its structural complexity.",

To investigate these challenges, we observed three teachers managing robotic activities across fifteen standard school sessions, followed by retrospective interviews. In these sessions, students performed group activities on assembling and programming different robotic platforms. The results highlight a) how managing the additional technical complexity of the robotic activity is challenging for teachers b) teachers interventions focus on supporting students make connections between their programs and their robot behaviour in the real-world.

Simultaneously, we witness the gradual addition of innovative technologies in non-pharmacological interventions in this population segment. However, no studies have synthesized the main contributions of the use of technology in group-based RT sessions. Aim: To map the available evidence on group-based RT sessions/activities aided by technological innovations, and critically discussed the potentialities and weaknesses of its use. Methods: Scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Two independent reviewers analyzed the relevance of the studies, extracted and synthesized data. Results: Seven studies were included. Overall, the use of technological aids potentiates the interaction and communication between older adults with dementia, staff, and relatives. Nevertheless, issues related to ergonomics, connectivity, and intention of use emerge as recurrent pitfalls. Conclusion: While technological aids can foster a more personalized and dynamic group-based RT session, the development of such innovations must follow an user-centered approach that involves older adults with different stages of dementia in order to create solutions with significance and applicability to its end-users.",

abstract="In spite of decades of research, the essence of central IS phenomena such as information, the IT artifact, and the Information System, remain unsettled. This aggravates the identification and definition of their neural correlates, which in turn may stymie the future potential of NeuroIS. To this end, the purpose of this paper is to define an intellectual core for the NeuroIS field, which is based on the dialectics between the individual and her social environment. Such a core enables a reconceptualization of information, the IT artifact, and the Information System as distinct ontological phenomena, however dialectically related. Accordingly, their neural correlates can be more distinctly defined, which opens up for alternative research questions. An example of a NeuroIS study addressing such questions is provided. Thus, the paper contributes to the formulation of a foundation for the future advancement of NeuroIS.",

abstract="The highly automated driving vehicles relief a certain amount of driving loads but also bring problems on how to get drivers' attention back to control when it is necessary. This paper proposed a design concept of multilevel alert takeover information and developed a simulated driving system, and the investigated questionnaires were used to evaluate the takeover performance and user experience. Results show that both levels and channels affect alert efficiency. Multilevel alerts are not able to significantly enhance driving takeover performance but effectively improve user experience. Auditory alert information enables drivers to perceive the risks more quickly, while visual alert information assists drivers to learn about the risk degree more efficiently. It is suggested to add personal experience to motivate the takeover ambitious in further study.",

abstract="The recent years have seen a digital transformation of the cultural tourism sector and the interpretation of cultural heritage, through the use of emerging and immersive technologies, such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). Although this transformation has brought important advantages, it may also challenge the authenticity of the offered experience. This paper aims to explore the different and conflicting scholarly debates on authenticity and technology, which lie at the intersection of three fields, namely tourism studies, heritage studies and ICT and which may also have consequences on the actual applicability of such technologies in cultural tourism. An examination of the concept of authenticity in the aforementioned disciplines is provided, through an analysis of how the concept has evolved in each of the three disciplines. The paper also highlights their differences and points of convergence and discusses the challenges and implications created by the identified discrepancies between the different stakeholders involved in cultural tourism. Finally, suggestions will be offered on how the discussed challenges and implications can be addressed in light of the new needs of cultural tourism in the digital era.",

abstract="The theme of this contribution is the world of video games, with particular focus on modern narrative video games whose communicational mode is based on mainly visual forms. In other words, the complexity of these games also regards the ideation of graphical expedients used for communicational purposes in the dynamics of the game. With respect to this field, the studies therefore focus on the theme of visual communication in modern graphical video games, with the goal of investigating different expressive forms. This was addressed on two planes. First, analyses and comparisons were proposed and made among different examples of video games, pausing on some elements of the language and visual grammar. Second, an attempt was made to understand if and how some of the expedients used in this field are really communicational artifices and representational principles used historically in classical and contemporary art, always with a precise intention, that is, to convey a message.",

abstract="We conducted a preliminary study to investigate how an immersive 3D environment based on novel technology can be used in simulator studies in nuclear domain. Our ultimate aim is to better understand the cognitive processes in achieving an overview of the nuclear process in a virtual reality control room (VR CR). The VR-environment was created by importing 3D-models into the Unity design environment. A novel headset was used offering a blend between the central high-resolution display and a larger lower-resolution context display. Two operator crews participated in the main test, and one crew for the pilot test. In brief simulated incidents and accidents the operators had to detect a fault and start to manage it; in a longer run, a sudden fire in the CR was simulated, forcing the crew to move to the Emergency CR. After each trial, the operators were interviewed and asked to describe what they had done during the trial, what information they had used and what hypothesis they had made about the cause of the fault. The results showed that the crews were able to successfully complete their tasks and manage the incident/accident, even though the development of the VR CR is still in progress.",

abstract="Anatomographics is a neologism that intends to embrace the wide range of digital representations and images dealing with anatomy. However, this last term seems by now no more confined to the medical disciplines but instead able to describe approaches and methodologies that are typical of other fields of expertise. In this framework, the paper tries to outline how much the digital revolution has influenced medical and architectural anatomographics providing an insight on common approaches, data processing and visualization. The analysis carried out on some representative examples clearly show that 3D modelling and 3D imaging are standing out as major interleaved methodologies in which geometric points on one side and pixels on the other create new unexpected interactive tools to understand the anatomic complexity of bodies and buildings.",

The automotive field is rich of interior style solutions, but the topics linked to interaction design and digital user experience are relatively young and need a different approach. In fact, if the higher limits were considered the cognitive workload, the attention and the reaction times required by a still semi-automatic drive, what are the methods to follow in order to obtain an innovative user experience, that also considers the aspects of complexity and of personal digital connections? The presented case study aims to describe the methodological approach and the first concepts developed for the research project that studies an innovative interface system for an autonomous vehicle, able to travel both on the ground and in flight.",

abstract="Cloudlet is introduced to decrease the distance between Main Cloud and mobile users, which directly helps to decrease the latency during game video transmission from the Cloud to mobile users. In this proposed work, a Pre-Stored Cloudlet is introduced. Pre-stored Cloudlet is where the Cloudlet is pre-stored with encoded game videos in it transmitted from the Main Cloud. The main drawbacks of the existing Mobile Cloud Gaming (MCG) are long distances between the Cloud and mobile users, strongly dependent on network, it consumes high bandwidth and causes latency. We proposed a system architecture to overcome the existing problem in MCG by introducing Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc mobile network into the architecture of MCG. Ad Hoc mobile network is formed within the range of Pre-Stored Cloudlets to enable the users to get the pre-rendered game videos from the nearby users. The proposed system has THREE main layers; Cloud, Cloudlet and mobile users and the video transmission is expected to happen between these layers aided with WiMax and WiFi connection. The architecture is implemented through simulation and it is simulated to find the Response Delay which consist of Network Delay, Processing Delay, and Playout Delay. Based on the simulation results obtained, it shows that the introduction of Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc environment has helped to decrease the latency in game video transmission.",

Since we started the work on Dataset Search in 2016, the number of datasets described in schema.org has grown from 500K to almost 30M. Thus, this corpus has become a valuable snapshot of data on the Web. To the best of our knowledge, this corpus is the largest and most diverse of its kind. We analyze this corpus and discuss where the datasets originate from, what topics they cover, which form they take, and what people searching for datasets are interested in. Based on this analysis, we identify gaps and possible future work to help make data more discoverable.",

A Virtual Equipment System is a system that takes advantage of the spatial information from a user's body by equipping them with virtual counterparts of common wearables. It provides ways to quickly adjust a suite of functions that are conceptually related using spatial knowledge of human anatomy corresponding to the equipment. The system can also be used to provide shortcuts for interacting with properties of other objects related to the user's sensory channels. As a software solution, this Virtual Equipment System can be standardized and implemented across different devices and applied to different extended realities.",

In this paper, we introduce a way to automatically measure a person's moral values through hidden ``honest'' signals in the person's e-mail communication. We measured the e-mail behavior of 26 users through their e-mail interaction, calculating their seven ``honest signals of collaboration'' (strong leadership, balanced contribution, rotating leadership, responsiveness, honest sentiment, shared context and social capital). These honest signals---in other words, how they answered their e-mails---explained 70{\%} of their moral values measured with the moral foundations survey. In particular, the more positive and less emotional they were in their language, the more they cared about others. We verified the results with a larger e-mail dataset of 655 employees of a services firm, where structural and temporal honest signals explained 67{\%} of emotionality.",
