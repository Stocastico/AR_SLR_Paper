the learning process of students through applications and platforms that
offer interactive and intuitive experiences. This article presents the
design of an interactive learning tool called FisicARtivo, which is
focused on teaching physics with real-time simulations in extended
reality (XR), using technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and
virtual reality (VR) for the presentation of interactive learning
environments. Preliminary results obtained in this work show that the
use of extended reality technologies has a significant impact on physics

abstract = {Coding skills have become the new language of communication for the tech
world. At an educational level, applying the concepts and logic of
programming is a complex task for the student. The investigation of this
problem was carried out with the intention of knowing if there are tools
that could help the student understand programming by using augmented
reality technology. For this purpose, a systematic mapping study was
carried out to identify, filter and classify the information through a
query applied in different ways of research. As a result, 34 articles
were selected and classified. The main results show that: a) programming
learning is not limited in terms of the student's age; b) Augmented
reality has potential advantages in programming learning; c) Due to the
extensive content of the programming, applications focused on specific
topics were found according to the level of studies; d) The software
used in the development of AR applications, mostly uses Unity with
Vuforia; and, e) Augmented reality contributes to different learning
techniques and styles that improve the way information is perceived and
visualized. In conclusion, augmented reality technology has proven to
have positive consequences in the programming learning process,
providing a starting point for the development of a tool that
contributes to the programming learning based on the characteristics
found and analyzed in this document.},
