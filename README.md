# AR_SLR_Paper
Code for the Collaborative AR SLR paper

This repo contains all the papers we read when preparing this SLR, as well as the spreadsheets used to keeo track of everything.

The figures used in the papers are generated through the **create_figures.ipynb** jupyter notebook.

We stopped collecting data on 1 October 2020.
